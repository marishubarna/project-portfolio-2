<h2>Grand Canyon</h2>
 <p>
This incredible natural attraction is one of the most 
visited places in the United States. Carved out by the 
Colorado River, the Grand Canyon cuts deep into the landscape, 
creating dramatic cliff walls and ledges. Visitors standing on 
the rim of the canyon can see down to the canyon floor a mile 
below, and look out over the ridges and cliffs that run as far 
as the eye can see.
The South Rim, about 4.5 hours by car from Las Vegas, is the most 
visited section of Grand Canyon National Park. This is where 
you'll find a large visitor center, regular bus service along 
the Rim in the high season, and a walkway that runs along the 
canyon with numerous viewing points and platforms. Several 
wonderful hikes, including the Bright Angel Trail, leave from 
here.The Skywalk, a glass bridge leading out over the edge of 
the Grand Canyon is another popular attraction. It is located 
at Eagle Point, on the West Rim. This area is about a four-hour 
drive from the South Rim, but usually less than a 2.5-hour drive 
from Las Vegas. If you are planning a day trip from Las Vegas, 
this area is a good option
The North Rim, which also has lookout areas, provides a different 
perspective. This section of the park is less visited and has 
limited access from November to May due to snow and winter 
conditions.

cloud. The bridge is approximately two miles long and part of Hwy

<h2>Deep-dish ‘Chicago-style’ pizza</h2>
 <p>
Back in 1943, two Chicago-based pizza lovers created 
a pizza like no other. The Chicago deep dish boasted 
a thick and deep crust hugely different from the thin-crusted 
Neapolitan-style pizzas of the time. The result was a taller 
pizza that allowed extra room for toppings and sauce. So if 
you’re yet to try a Chicago deep dish, know that it’s not to 
be rushed and gobbled up hastily on-the-go. A knife and fork 
are often required to tuck into this mouth-watering monster. </p>

<h2>Fluffy American pancakes</h2>
<p>These fluffy pillows of deliciousness are the 
ultimate comfort food craving. And nowhere are they 
more heavenly and soft than in the USA. Why? Because 
American pancakes use raising flour which means pancakes 
pile high to the ceilings of brunch shops and home kitchens. 
Needless to say, they’re hugely popular and any newcomer to 
the USA must drizzle syrup over a pancake stack as an American 
food culture rite of passage. For toppings: choose between 
blueberries, strawberries, Nutella or lemon juice – and sink your 
teeth in for an unforgettable bite.</p>

<h2>Key Lime Pie</h2>
<p>Another pie on this list is the key lime pie with the 
creamy custard flavored with solid citrusy key lime zest 
and juice. Don’t mistake key lime juice for regular lime 
juice it will offer a stronger scent and is more often 
used for desserts, sweets, and beverages.
One more surprising fact about these lime pies is they are 
even more “American” than the apple ones. Back in the 1800s,
a while after apple appeared, the Key West’s fishermen started 
mixing lime juice with wild bird eggs (or turtle eggs) and 
condensed milk.
That was the original form of this lime pie until a woman 
called Aunt Sally made it more widespread with her own lime 
pie recipe.</p>

<h2>Fruit Smoothies</h2>
<p>
America is a modern and dynamic country; people will 
be pretty busy at breakfast. Most of them will choose 
quick solutions like store-bought burgers, sandwiches 
and some will opt for healthy ones like a fruit smoothie.
Just by using a variety of fruits in the refrigerator and 
a little milk or oats, they have completed their breakfast 
in 5 minutes.
This tasteful treat was first sold on the West Coast of the 
US in the 1930s. But it was not until the 1980s that people 
used the term “smoothies” more commonly.
However, it is not good to only get nutrition from fruit for a 
long time. Therefore, many variations require protein powder or 
other supplements, and you can try them out.

<h2>Roasted Turkey</h2>
<p>In many families across the United States and Canada, 
the image of a golden roasted turkey on the dinner table 
has become a symbol of Thanksgiving. Yet, the actual theory 
behind the existence of this delicacy remains unclear until
nowadays.
The most supported theory is Thanksgiving dates back to 1621, 
with a party held at Plymouth Plantation.
The Plymouths invited the Wampanoag (Native Americans) to 
celebrate successful crops, where they serve one of the tribe’s 
featured chickens. The chicken used was thought to be a turkey 
and became the inspiration for the following Thanksgiving parties.

<div class="fact1">
<h3> <strong>1.</strong>AMERICA IS HOME TO MANY NATURAL WONDERS</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt1">America is home to many natural wonders of the 
world. In fact, the United Nations Education, Scientific, and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) have recognized many heritage sites 
in America. According to UNESCO, a world heritage site is a place 
of special cultural or physical significance.

<h3> <strong>2.</strong>THE US HAS THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<img class="texxt-images" src="images/interestusa2.jpg" height="400px" alt="">
 <p class="texxt2">The United States has maintained its position 
of being the world’s largest economy since 1871. The economy is 
so large that the US is often noted as an economic superpower 
and this is due to the fact that it makes up almost a quarter 
of the global economy.
The US economy is connected to the country’s enormous population, 
technological innovation, high consumer spending, high average 
incomes, as well as a moderate unemployment rate.
 </p>                     
</div>

<div class="fact1">
<h3> <strong>3.</strong>THE US DOESN'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE </h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt">While English is predominantly spoken across 
the United States, on a federal level there are no laws stating 
that English is the official language. However, even though there 
are no federal laws, 31 states have declared English the official 
language.
Further, there are only a few states that are officially bilingual. 
For example, in New Mexico, the official language is English and 
Spanish, whereas, in Louisiana, the official language is English 
and French, and finally, in Hawaii, the official language is 
English and Hawaiian.

<h3> <strong>4.</strong>HOME TO SOME OF THE GREATEST MUSICAL ARTISTS OF ALL TIME</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<img class="texxt-images" src="images/interestusa4.jpg" height="350px" alt="">
<p class="texxt">
The Music Industry in the U.S. is huge, and globally, 
the majority of the music we listen to comes from America. 
There are so many music superstars with origins in the USA.
Some of the greatest artists of all time include Elvis Presley, 
Michael Jackson, Metallica, Eminem, Beyonce, Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash,
Billy Joel, Whitney Houston, Ray Charles, Madonna, Nirvana, 
Bruno Mars, Guns n’ Roses, Bon Jovi, Jimi Hendrix, 
Bruce Springsteen, Kiss, Marvin Gaye, Tupac and Frank Sinatra 
just to mention a few.
The list could go on and on because so many hits have been made by 
American artists, and you will find all kinds of music from every 
genre.

<div class="fact1">
<h3> <strong>5.</strong> WASHINGTON, DC WASN'T ALWAYS THE CAPITAL OF AMERICA </h3>
<div class=" contextss">                                                                       
<p class="texxt">
Many recognize Washington, DC as the capital of the United States 
but that wasn’t always the case. Washington didn’t become the 
capital until 1790.
Believe it or not, from 1785 until 1790, New York City served as 
the countries capital. While it may not be the capital today, over 
8 million people reside in New York City, making it the most 
populous city in America, and it’s one of the best cities to 
visit in the USA. While it is one of the best places to visit 
it is also one of the rudest cities in America, so be sure to 
choose your words carefully with the locals.
