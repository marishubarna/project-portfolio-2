<h2>Niagara Falls </h2>
 <p>
is Canada's most famous natural attraction, 
bringing in millions of visitors each year. Located just 
over an hour's drive from Toronto, along the American border, 
these massive falls drop approximately 57 meters. You can see 
the falls at an astoundingly close distance from several key 
points.
Niagara Falls and the Niagara Gorge have been attracting 
tourists and daredevils for well over a century. Between the 
mid-19th and mid-20th centuries there were numerous attempts 
to plunge over the falls in various types of homemade boats 
and barrels. This, along with tightrope walkers and other 
spectacles, led to the adjacent town of Niagara Falls developing a 
carnival type atmosphere that still persists today.
Families will enjoy a walk down Niagara's outrageous Clifton 
Hill leading to the gorge and falls. Other popular things to 
do here include a cruise to the base of the falls, a trip up 
the Skylon Tower for a fantastic aerial view, and a look from 
the bottom of the falls on the Journey Behind the Falls 
experience.</p>

<h2>Banff National Park & the Rocky Mountains</h2>
<p>Banff National Park lies in the heart of the majestic 
Rocky Mountains in the province of Alberta, and showcases 
some of Canada's most beautiful scenery. Turquoise-colored 
lakes, snowcapped peaks, and glaciers are all easily accessible 
in this stunning park. Take a scenic drive or head off on one 
of the best hikes in Banff.
The jewel of the park is Lake Louise, where green waters 
reflect the surrounding mountains and glaciers, and visitors 
can stroll easily around the shores. Just a short distance is 
Moraine Lake, another impressive alpine lake with an even 
slightly more dramatic surrounding.
The Icefields Parkway, which runs from Lake Louise to Jasper, 
is an unforgettable drive and another major attraction in Banff.
 At the south end of the park is the lovely little town of Banff, 
 providing all kinds of options for accommodation, shopping, 
 dining, and nightlife.
Banff is also a major winter sports area and home to Lake Louise 
Ski Resort and Sunshine Village, two of Canada's best ski 
destinations.</p>

<h2>Old Montreal</h2>
<p>Old Montreal, lined with lovely historic buildings, 
is a place to go for great shopping and fine dining. 
While Montreal itself is a vibrant modern city, Old 
Montreal, down by the waterfront, is where you'll want 
to go to soak up the atmosphere.
Some of the must-see places in Old Montreal include Rue 
Bonsecours and the landmark Marché Bonsecours in the old 
town hall building, the interior of the beautiful Notre-Dame 
Basilica, the lively Place Jacques-Cartier, and the 1870s 
City Hall.</p>

<h2>Vancouver's Stanley Park</h2>
<p>
One of Vancouver's greatest treasures is the 405-hectare 
Stanley Park, conveniently located on the west side of the 
downtown area. Situated on a peninsula, the park is surrounded 
by the ocean and home to huge red cedar and Douglas fir trees. 
The seawall, which rings the park, has an extensive walking, 
jogging, and biking path with designated lanes for walkers and 
bikers. From the seawall are some lovely views of the city and 
mountains. A scenic drive also winds through Stanley Park with 
numerous pullouts.
Within the park are the Vancouver Aquarium, scenic Beaver Lake, 
and the Stanley Park Pavilion and Rose Garden. Also of special 
interest are numerous totem poles, some of which were erected 
more than 100 years ago. In the spring, the cherry trees burst 
into bloom in an amazing display.

<h2>Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada</h2>
<p>As a newer attraction to the city’s line-up of awesome 
things to do, Ripley’s Aquarium has certainly made a splash 
in a short amount of time. See what we did there? Gotta love 
our aquarium puns!
The Aquarium is home to the longest underwater glass tunnel 
in North America – it extends through the “Dangerous Lagoon”. 
This is where you come face-to-face with some scary predators 
like sharks and eels.
In all, there are 9 different galleries and over 400 species 
to check out. You are sure to find something you enjoy! The 
place is so popular – they recommend visiting before 10 am or 
after 3 pm to beat the crowds.
If you are planning a visit to Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada 
and know which day, consider a Ripley’s Aquarium “After Hours” 
ticket that is valid for a night visit after 7:00 pm. Crowds 
can be smaller and admission is actually reduced from the daily 
fare.</p>

<h2>The CN Tower </h2>
<p>was once the world’s tallest structure, 
but it is still clinging to the top 10. We’ve visited a 
lot of towers around the world, but the CN Tower is still 
the best experience. It’s one of the top tourist attractions 
in Toronto and with good reason. That’s saying a lot as there 
are so many things to do in Canada’s largest city but we never 
tire of bringing people to the CN Tower when they visit.
With its hair-raising glass floor, rotating restaurant, and 
the adrenaline-pumping Edgewalk, it’s a must-see attraction 
when visiting Toronto. Be sure to go up the CN Tower for city 
views and if you love adventure, make sure to try the EdgeWalk.

<h2>Gros Morne National Park</h2>
<p>
Newfoundland's Gros Morne National Park is more remote 
than many of Canada's most popular national parks, but 
worth the effort to discover this beautiful landscape 
of mountains and fjords. The park is a UNESCO World 
Heritage Site featuring steep cliff walls, waterfalls, 
and interesting rock formations carved by the glacier-fed 
waters.
Most visitors take a boat tour to appreciate the scenery, 
but there are also hiking trails and opportunities for 
kayaking. In winter, the park receives far fewer visitors, 
but is open for ski touring, complete with backcountry ski huts.

<h2>Victoria's Inner Harbour</h2>
<p>Few Canadian cities have done such a beautiful job 
of developing their waterfront area as Victoria and 
its Inner Harbour. This is a great place for strolling, 
relaxing, shopping, dining, and watching street performers 
all against the backdrop of the harbor.
The centerpiece of this area is the historic Empress Hotel, 
one of the city's most lovely buildings. Over the years, 
the Empress has welcomed kings and queens and, today, 
features a traditional high tea, which is one of the 
highlights for many visitors coming to Victoria. While 
the harbor area is popular year-round, it is particularly 
lively during the summer months.</p>

<h2>Canadian Museum Of Human Rights</h2>
<p>
We don’t put museums in lists of iconic places, but the 
Canadian Museum of Human Rights in Winnipeg is one of the 
best museums in the world.
The museum itself is beautifully designed winning 
many architectural awards taking the visitor on a 
journey from the ground floor representing roots and 
soil through mountains, earth, clouds, and light with 
exhibits like the Garden of Contemplation and the glass 
tower overlooking the city of Winnipeg.
Winnipeg's newest major attraction, which has drawn 
both national and international attention, is the 
Canadian Museum for Human Rights. Opened in 2014 near 
The Forks, the building displays a unique design that 
is eye-catching to say the least, with geometry and 
colors based on images of the Canadian landscape.
Also unique is the concept behind the museum, which 
proved controversial when deciding which histories 
would be featured here. The museum highlights personal 
stories, capturing different perspectives, and focuses 
on a range of themes.

<h2>Poutine (Quebec)</h2>
 <p>
Naturally, we are going to start with poutine, because nothing 
truly gets more Canadian than poutine. Poutine — Crispy fries, 
squeaky cheese curds, and rich gravy all come together to make 
the ultimate comfort food — is a classic Canadian food, said to 
have originated in Quebec City during the 1950s. Poutine was 
created in Quebec City in 1950, and the French-Canadian dish 
has taken over Canada and is beloved by everyone ever since.
The dish has become so famous that it can now be found all 
around the world. Whilst the traditional recipe is already 
tasty, poutines topped with things like pulled pork and bacon, 
smoked meat and pre-cooked, shredded lobster meat are very 
popular as well. If you are near downtown Montreal, you should 
try the poutine from La Banquise – The best poutine on earth 
according to most people.</p>

<h2>Hawaiian Pizza (Ontario)</h2>
<p>The modern pizza we know today emerged from dishes 
created in the 18th and 19th centuries in Naples, Italy. 
Hawaiian pizza is a regional variation of the dish, which 
typically consists of ham and pineapple, as well as cheese 
and tomato sauce.
It did not originate in Hawaii, despite the name. The first 
known Hawaiian pizza was created at a restaurant in Ontario 
Canada in 1962 by a Greek immigrant called Sam Panopoulos. 
Inspired by his trip to Naples, he decided to introduce pizza 
to the menu.
Today at some point in the never-ending debate on whether or 
not pineapple belongs on pizza, there are two types of people 
in Canada: those who like pineapple on pizza and those who 
don’t. You should try it out to find out which group you are in. </p>

<h2>Nanaimo bars (Vancouver)</h2>
<p>This rich tri-layered dessert bar is made of crumb mixture, 
vanilla-flavoured butter icing, and melted chocolate. Its exact 
origin has never been confirmed, though a 1952 recipe for a 
“chocolate square” can be found in a book called The Ladies 
Auxiliary to the Nanaimo General Hospital. A year later, a 
cookbook was published with what’s believed to be the first 
recipe under the name “Nanaimo bar.”
Nanaimo Bars are a Canadian dessert staple originating 
in Nanaimo, a town on Vancouver Island, BC. It is made with 
a chocolate cracker crumb base, a custard icing and topped 
with a chocolate coating. It can be found at any café and 
sometimes in convenience stores.
Although Canada is where the Nanaimo bars originated, you 
can find them in many places around the world these days, 
but none are better than those found in Vancouver 
and British Columbia!</p>

<h2>Butter tarts (Ontario)</h2>
<p>
The butter tart is one of the few Canadian pastries. 
A butter tart is a small pastry tart made of butter, 
sugar, syrup, and egg that is put into a flaky pastry 
shell and baked until the filling is semi-solid and 
the top is crunchy. You can also find different variations 
such as walnuts or pecans. This recipe if you are looking 
to treat yourself.
The origin is attributed to the Filles du Roi (King’s Daughters), 
a group of roughly 800 young women from France who were transported 
to Québec to help populate the country between 1663 and 1673. 
These young girls carried their traditional European recipes 
with them, but they were compelled to modify them to the 
available ingredients.

<h2>London fog (Vancouver)</h2>
<p>The London Fog is a classic drink made with a carefully 
brewed cup of Organic Earl Grey, a dab of vanilla syrup, 
steamed milk, and a sprig of lavender.
The misty plume generated by the warm milk hitting the dark 
Earl Grey tea turned the colour of a foggy London afternoon, 
and thus the name was coined. The perfect warm and comforting 
drink for cold Canadian weather.
Those who aren’t familiar with the Pacific Northwest or Canada’s 
west coast may not know the London Fog by its various names: the 
Early Grey Latte, Vanilla Tea Misto, or Vancouver Fog.</p>

<h2>Top 5 interesting facts about Canada</h2>
</div>
</div>

<div class="fact1">
<h3> <strong>1.</strong>THE NAME  "CANADA" COMES FROM AN ABORIGINAL WORD </h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt2">The name "Canada" probably comes from the Huron-Iroquois word kanata, 
which means " village " or "settlement". In 1535, when two Aboriginal youths pointed out 
the way to kanata to the explorer Jacques Cartier, they were in fact referring to the village 
of Stadacona, the present-day site of Quebec City. For want of another name, Cartier named 
not only the village, but also the entire territory governed by its chief, Donnacona, " Canada.
Soon, explorers and fur traders ventured west and south, and the territory known as Canada grew. 
In the early eighteenthe century, the name referred to all the French lands that now make up the 
American mid-west and extend south to Louisiana.
The name Canada was first officially used in 1791, when the province of Quebec was divided into 
two colonies: Upper Canada and Lower Canada. In 1841, the two Canadas were united under the
name of the Province of Canada.
In the same idea, the name "Quebec" comes from the Algonquin word "Kebec" which means 
"where the river narrows".

<h3> <strong>2.</strong> HOCKEY IS NOT THE ONLY NATIONAL SPORT IN CANADA</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
    
<img class="texxt-images"  src="images/interesfactcanada4.avif" height="500px" alt="">
 <p class="texxt2">
And yes, hockey is the national sport in winter, but in summer, it is Lacrosse. 
With its French-sounding name, one might think that the sport of lacrosse has crossed the pond from Europe to Canada.
Lacrosse was actually first played by First Nations people in the 1600s. 
The sport was then adopted by Canada's English-speaking middle classes in the 
19th century and was officially declared Canada's national sport by an act of Parliament in 1994. 
This sport is played with a stick (a stick with a net at the end). 
The aim is to catch, pass and carry a rubber ball in order to score goals 
for the opposing team. There are different types of sticks: <br>
<br>
Men's field lacrosse: is played outdoors on grass and consists of 2 teams of 10 players. 
A game lasts 80 minutes divided into 20-minute quarters. It is a contact sport requiring special 
equipment and protection (similar to hockey or American football).
<br>
Women's field lacrosse: This is played outdoors on grass and involves two teams of 12 players. 
It is played without contact, so the equipment is lighter. Each game lasts 60 minutes (2 halves of 30 minutes).
<br>
The game is particularly dynamic and scores rise quickly as teams are required to shoot at the goal every 30 seconds.

<div class="fact1">
<h3> <strong>3.</strong>CANADA PRODUCES MOST OF THE WORLD'S MAPLE SYRUP </h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt1">
Topping our list of fun facts about Canada is a 
familiar Canadian condiment. There’s a very good 
reason maple syrup has become a Canadian stereotype—we 
have so much of it! In fact, the Canadian province of 
Quebec produces 72 percent of the world’s maple syrup 
output. The United States is the next largest producer, 
while Japan and South Korea have small operations of their 
own. For more maple syrup-related content, we highly 
recommend you read all about the Great Canadian Maple 
Syrup Heist. No, we did not make that up – it’s a real 
thing!

<h3> <strong>4.</strong>CANADA'S LOWEST RECORDED TEMPERATURE IS AS COLD AS MARS </h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<img  class="texxt-images" src="images/interesfactcanada7.webp" height="300px" alt="">

<p class="texxt">
One of the least surprising facts about Canada is that it 
can get pretty cold in the winter (anyone who’s ever had 
to chisel their car out of a block of ice in the morning 
knows this to be true). The average low for the month of 
January in Ottawa is -14.4 C (6.1 F). That’s pretty cold! 
However, a temperature recorded in 1947 in Snag, Yukon makes 
the rest of Canada’s winter weather seem like a relaxing 
beach vacation. A temperature of -63 C (-81.4 F) was recorded 
in the small village of Snag on Feb. 3, 1947. That’s roughly 
the same temperature as the surface of Mars!

<h3> <strong>5.</strong>CANADA'S NATIONAL PARKS ARE BIGGER THAN MOST COUNTRIES</h3>

<p class="texxt">
Canada is so vast, even our parks dwarf other countries. 
Just look at Nahanni National Park Reserve in the Northwest 
Territories (above): not only is it a sight to behold with 
massive waterfalls, it’s also an incredible 30,050 square 
kilometres—bigger than Albania and Israel. Wood Buffalo 
National Park in Alberta and the Northwest Territories is 
even bigger at 44,807 square kilometres, which makes it 
bigger than Denmark and Switzerland.
