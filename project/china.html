                    <h2>Chicken Fried Rice</h2>
                    <p>Cooked in a wok or frying pan, this dish tosses fried rice with egg, vegetables, and chicken over
                        steamy temperatures. Often made with local ingredients, chicken fried rice can be made in
                        countless variations, sometimes not including chicken at all, allowing for substitutes like
                        seafood or other proteins creating room for artistry and experimentation.</p>

            <h3> <strong>1.</strong> The Great Wall of China is actually a collection of walls </h3>
            <div class=" contextss">
                <p class="texxt">It is a common belief that the Great Wall is just one continuous length. However this iconic architectural wonder is actually a network of walls spanning over 20,000 km. Emperor Qin connected the walls over 2,000 years ago in order to defend the first unified kingdom of China. Another interesting fact, workers used glutinous rice flour in the mortar due to its stickiness. We suggest taking a guided tour of this UNESCO Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of The World so you can learn more about the top tourist attraction in China.

            <h3> <strong>2.</strong>Chinese food varies greatly from region to region </h3>
            <div class=" contextss">
                <img class="texxt-images" src="images/china22.webp" height="400px" alt="">
                <p class="texxt">During your travels in China, make sure to try the tasty regional dishes. Chinese food is based on five key flavours, sweet, sour, salty, bitter and spicy,  which need to all balance with each other to form one harmonious dish. Chinese food eaten in China is much fresher and more unusual than you would get in your local takeaway. Peking duck, Cantonese beef soup, fried rice, and pork noodles are just some of the specialities served here.

            <div class=" contextss">
                <p class="texxt1">The Forbidden City was the Chinese Imperial Palace during the Ming Dynasty and served as the home of emperors for almost 500 years. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its finely preserved collection of ancient buildings in China. The design of the Forbidden City was meticulously planned to reflect philosophical and religious principles of the Ming Dynasty and to symbolise the majesty of Imperial power.

            <h3> <strong>5.</strong>Pandas spend the majority of the day eating</h3>
            <div class=" contextss">
                <p class="texxt">
                    Pandas’ famous diet mainly consists of bamboo and they spend between 10-16 hours a day eating! Giant Pandas are the national animal of China and unlike other species of bear, they do not hibernate. One of the best places to see pandas in China is the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Centre, which you can experience on our Highlights of China including the Yangtze Cruise tour.
