<div class="text">
<h2>Pyramids of Giza </h2>
 <p>
The last surviving wonder of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pyramids of Giza are one of the world's most recognizable landmarks.
Having awed travelers down through the ages, these tombs of the Pharaohs Khufu (Cheops), Khafre (Chephren), and Menkaure (Mycerinus), guarded by the enigmatic Sphinx, are usually top of most visitor's lists of tourist attractions to see in Egypt and often the first sight they head to after landing.
Today, sitting on the desert edge of Cairo's sprawl, these megalithic memorials to dead pharaohs are still as wondrous a sight as they ever were and an undeniable highlight of any Egypt trip.
To beat the crowds, get here around 7:30am and enter through the main Pyramid of Khufu site entrance (rather than the Sphinx entrance). This means you can have finished exploring the interior tunnels and burial chambers of the Pyramid of Khufu by the time the tour buses start pulling in at 8:15am.
Most visitors limit their site visit to the three pyramids and the Sphinx, but there is plenty more to see on the Giza Plateau. If you can, reserve time to explore the funerary complexes of the eastern cemetery (on the east side of the Pyramid of Khufu). The tombs of 6th dynasty high officials Qar and Idu and the tomb of Meresankh III (who was one of Pharaoh Khafre's wives) are all open to the public. </p>

<h2>Cruising the Nile</h2>
<p>Egypt is defined by the Nile. For many visitors, a 
multi-day cruise upon this famed waterway that saw the 
rise of the Pharaonic era is a highlight of their Egypt trip.
Cruising the Nile is also the most relaxing way to see the 
temples that stud the banks of the river on the route between
Luxor and Aswan, plus sunrise and sunset over the date-palm-studded 
river banks, backed by sand dunes, is one of Egypt's most tranquil vistas.
The two famous sights on a Nile Cruise are the Temple of Kom Ombo 
and Edfu's Temple of Horus, where all the big cruise boats stop.
If you'd prefer a less crowded and slower experience, though, and don't 
mind "roughing it" a bit, you can also cruise the Nile by felucca (Egypt's 
traditional lateen-sailed wooden boats), which also allows you to create your own itinerary.
The vast amount of cruise boat itineraries depart from either Luxor or Aswan, 
but feluccas can only be chartered for multi-day trips from Aswan.</p>

<h2>Abu Simbel</h2>
<p>Even in a country festooned with temples, Abu Simbel is something special. This is Ramses II's great temple, adorned with colossal statuary standing guard outside, and with an interior sumptuously decorated with wall paintings.
Justly famous for its megalithic proportions, Abu Simbel is also known for the incredible engineering feat carried out by UNESCO in the 1960s, which saw the entire temple moved from its original setting to save it from disappearing under the rising water of the Aswan Dam.
Today, exploring Abu Simbel is just as much about admiring the triumph of this international effort to save the temple complex as it is about gaping in wonder at Ramses II's awe-inspiring building works, itself.
Most people arrive in Abu Simbel on organized day trips from Aswan, which all have an early morning start to get to the temple complex at 8am or 9am.
After 11am, nearly everyone has cleared out and headed back to Aswan. To wander through Ramses II's colossal monument without the crowds, overnight in Abu Simbel village itself and visit the temples after midday.</p>

<h2>Diving the Red Sea</h2>
<p>
Below the Red Sea's surface is another world as fascinating as the temples and tombs on land.
The coral reefs of the Red Sea are renowned among scuba divers for both the soft corals on display and the vast amount of sea life, ranging from colorful reef fish and nudibranchs to sharks, dolphins, turtles, rays, and even dugongs.
For divers, the most famous town to base yourself in is Sharm el-Sheikh on the Sinai Peninsula, closest to the reefs of Ras Mohammed National Park, as well as the reefs of the Straits of Tiran.
 To dive the sites of the Straits of Gubal head to Hurghada or El Gouna on the Red Sea coast, while advanced divers should check out the resort of Marsa Alam, the nearest base for diving Egypt's "deep south" dive sites. 
 As well as fish life and coral, the Red Sea is a major wreck-diving destination. The most famous wreck is the Thistlegorm, a British WWII cargo ship that was on its way to resupply Allied troops when it was bombed by the Germans in 1941.
 Today the site is regarded by divers as one of the top five wreck dives in the world due to the vast cargo of cars, motorbikes, and WWII memorabilia that can be seen both scattered on the sea bed around the wreck and inside the ship itself.

<h2>Egyptian Museum</h2>
<p>A treasure trove of the Pharaonic world, Cairo's Egyptian Museum is one of the world's 
great museum collections. The faded pink mansion in downtown Cairo is home to a dazzling amount of exhibits.
The museum's exhibits cover the breadth of the Pharaonic era with highlights including its 
artifacts from pre-dynastic Egypt, the Old Kingdom galleries displaying the fine statuary 
from Egypt's period of pyramid builders, and the displays of glittering funerary goods 
unearthed from the country's most famous tomb finds.
Make sure to reserve enough time at the museum to fully view the galleries devoted to the 
grave goods of Yuya and Thuya and the royal tombs of Tanis (both upstairs).
Until Giza's much-delayed Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) opens, the Egyptian Museum is also 
where you come to see a selection of the riches from Tutankhamen's Valley of the Kings tomb. 
When the GEM finally does open, these will be moved there (and the entire Tutankhamen collection 
will be displayed in full for the first time). </p>

<h2>White Desert</h2>
<p>Egypt's kookiest natural wonder is White Desert National Park, 
out in the Western Desert, just south of Bahariya Oasis. Here, surreally 
shaped chalk pinnacles and huge boulders loom over the desert plateau, 
creating a scene that looks like icebergs have found themselves stranded amid a landscape of sand.
This highly scenic environment looks like something out of a science 
fiction movie and is a favorite destination for 4WD desert trips and 
overnight camping, which are both easiest organized in Bahariya Oasis.
For desert fans and adventurers, this is the ultimate weird playground, 
while anybody who's had their fill of temples and tombs will enjoy this 
spectacular natural scenery.

<h2>Blue Hole (Dahab)</h2>
<p>
One of Egypt’s most popular dive sites, the Blue Hole, lies just north of 
Dahab on the southeast of the Sinai Peninsula. Dropping straight down for 
over a hundred meters, the sinkhole is brimming with colorful coral reefs and 
shimmering shoals of fish.
Due to the abundance of marine life and shoreline accessibility, recreational 
scuba divers line up to explore its underwater riches every day. While it is 
perfectly safe, the Blue Hole has unfortunately claimed the lives of a number 
of deep divers as they attempted to pass through its archway – a 26 meter-long 
tunnel which lies more than 55 meters below the surface.

<h2>St. Catherine's Monastery</h2>
<p>One of the oldest monasteries in the world, St. Catherine's stands at the foot of Mount Sinai, 
    amid the desert mountains of the Sinai Peninsula, where Moses is said to have received the Ten Commandments.
This desert monastery is home to an incredible collection of religious iconography, art, and manuscripts 
(some of which can be seen in the on-site museum), as well as the burning bush.
For most visitors here, a trip to St. Catherine's also involves a hike up Mount Sinai to see sunrise 
or sunset. Take the camel path for the easy route, or climb the famous Steps of Repentance if you want better views.</p>

<h2>Siwa Oasis</h2>
<p>
Sitting in isolation, in the western corner of the Western Desert, Siwa is the tranquil tonic 
to the hustle of Egypt's cities. This gorgeous little oasis, surrounded by date palm plantations 
and numerous hot-water springs, is one of the Western Desert's most picturesque spots.
Siwa town is centered around the ruins of a vast mud-brick citadel, known as the Fortress of 
Shali, which dominates the view, while various temple remnants, including the Temple of the 
Oracle where Alexander the Great is said to have come to receive advice, are scattered throughout 
the wider oasis area.
This is a top spot to wind down and go slow for a few days, as well as being an excellent base from 
which to plan adventures into the surrounding desert.

<h2>Shish Taouk (Chicken Kebab)</h2>
 <p>
Meat lovers, rejoice! Kofta is minced beef or lamb with plenty of spices 
thrown in, which is then rolled and grilled. You could call it an 
Egyptian-style sausage. Kebab is prepped with pieces of meat such as 
lamb or veal that are grilled over a coal fire on a skewer. These meat 
dishes are always accompanied by sides of dips, rice, bread, and veggies. 
This will most definitely put you in a happy food coma.</p>

<h2>Shawarma</h2>
<p>Although shawarma is not native to Egypt originally, it has become so since 
Egypt was part of the Ottoman Empire. Shawarma is layers of meat which could be 
lamb, chicken, or beef that are placed on a spit and grilled, all day long. The 
outer layers are then shaved off and chucked into a tasty hunk of bread or roll. 
Shawarma sangas are a big highlight.</p>

<h2>Sahlab</h2>
<p>
We first got a taste of this intriguing drink in Turkey and have never forgotten it. 
Sahlab (or salep) refers to both the drink and the flour used to make it. This thick, 
creamy, and fragrant drink is made with flour derived from the dried tubers of Orchis 
mascula, a genus of wild orchids.
Sahlab is traditionally made with orchid flour but these days, these flowers are 
becoming more rare and expensive so the drink is often made with sorghum flour or 
cornstarch instead. A mixture containing rice flour, cornstarch, shredded coconut, 
powdered milk, sugar, and vanilla is dissolved in milk and brought to a boil until 
it thickens. It’s then served hot or warm in cups garnished with cinnamon, raisins, 
and nuts.

<h2>Koshari</h2>
<p>Koshari (or kushari, koshary) is another Egyptian national dish. 
A popular street food in Cairo and the rest of Egypt, it consists of 
lentils, white rice, chickpeas, and macaroni topped with a spiced tomato 
sauce and crispy fried onions.
Koshari dates back to mid-19th century Egypt and is essentially a 
dish that was thrown together to make use of leftover pantry staples. 
Leftover white rice, lentils, and macaroni were mixed together and topped 
with whole chickpeas, fried onions, and a garlic-vinegar-spiked tomato sauce.
Initially, kosahri was sold from street carts in Egypt and was popular 
mainly among workers and laborers. It would later be introduced to restaurants 
and has now become one of the most beloved comfort foods in Egypt.</p>

<h3> <strong>1.</strong>Egypt is home to the Only Remaining Ancient Wonder in the World </h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt2">The only remaining monument of the 7 ancient wonders of the world is still standing in 
Egypt. Only the Great Pyramid of Giza, in El Giza, Egypt has stood the test of time. The Pyramids of Giza 
are located in the capital city of Cairo and are as awe-inspiring as they always have been. The Great 
Pyramid of Khufu is the largest of all the pyramids and it was built to house the Pharoah Khufu in the 
fourth century. Today is known as the pyramid of Cheops.You cannot miss visiting the pyramids when you 
travel to Cairo, they can be seen from all over the city. The Pyramid of Khufu is massive standing at a 
height of 146.7 meters (481 feet).

<h3> <strong>2.</strong>95 Percent of Egyptians Live Along the River Nile</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
    
<img class="texxt-images"  src="images/nile2.jpg" height="350px" alt="">
 <p class="texxt2">
Did you know that the longest river in the world is located in Egypt. The Nile River 
cuts through Egypt and about 95 percent of the population of Egypt resides along the 
Nile River.  With much of the country being occupied by desert, this fact about Egypt 
isn’t all that surprising. 90 percent of Egypt is made up of desert and the River Nile 
divides that desert.The ancient Egyptians divided Egypt into two lands, the desert, 
and the Nile Valley. Contrary to what you would think, upper Egypt is located in the 
South and Lower Egypt is north. That is because the Nile flows north towards the 
Mediterranean Sea.

<h3> <strong>3.</strong>Cats are Sacred</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt1">
It’s true, cats were considered sacred animals in ancient Egypt. 
And from what I could see from our visits to Egypt they are still 
cared for and revered. Our guesthouse in Cairo had plenty of cats 
hanging out on its rooftop terrace that we enjoyed cuddling with. 
ats were thought to bring good luck and they were so revered that 
when a cat died, the pharaohs had them mummified. As a cat lover, I can relate.

<h3> <strong>4.</strong>One of the World’s Largest Dams is Located in Egypt</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<img  class="texxt-images" src="images/high-Dam-Egypt.webp" height="300px" alt="">

<p class="texxt">
    Egypt is home to one of the world’s largest dams. The Aswan High Dam is the world’s 
    largest embankment dam, spanning across The Nile separating Egypt from Sudan and 
    creating Lake Nassar. Lake Nassar is one of the world’s largest reservoirs.
    While this seems like a great feat, when we cycled from Egypt to Sudan, we saw the 
    devastation that this dam caused. At one time, Sudan was lush and green along the 
    Nile and even tourists from the UK would vacation in Wadi Halfa in Sudan. Today, it 
    is a dried-up mess thanks to the damming of Lake Nassar.

<p class="texxt">
    Do you know that Egypt is also home to seven of the UNESCO World Heritage sites? 
    That’s right, Egypt has a lot to offer! The 7 sites are Abu Mena, Historic Cairo, 
    Abu Simbel, Saint Catherine, Wadi Al-Hitan, (aka Whale Valley in the western desert 
    of Egypt) and Memphis and its Necropolis, and Ancient Thebes. Have you been to any 
    of them?We have been to all but two. We have yet to visit Abu Mena or Whale Valley.
    Memphis and its Necropolis are in fact the Pyramid Fields from Giza to Dahshur so 
    chances are if you’ve been to Egypt, you have seen this UNESCO SIte. Ancient Thebes 
    is where you’ll find Luxor and the Valley of the Kings, Abu Simbel is on Lake Nasser, 
    Historic Cairo is an obvious destination and Saint Catherine is located at the foot 
    of mountains where Moses received the 10 Commandments.
