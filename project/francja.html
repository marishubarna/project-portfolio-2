                        several important European institutions during their
                        visit, including the European Parliament and the
                        Council of Europe. For an extra dose of charm,
                        arrive in December to see one of Europe's
                        oldest Christmas markets.

                    <h2>Colmar</h2>
                    <p>
                        It's easy to see why Colmar, located in
                        the heart of Alsace's wine region, is considered
                        one of France's most beautiful cities. Colorful
                        houses that look as if they belong in a fairy
                        tale line the Little Venice district, where
                        you can take a boat tour through Colmar's
                        canals or reach boutiques and eateries on foot.
                        The setting is picturesque regardless of
                        when you vacation here, but for even more charm,
                        visit Colmar at night when lights illuminate
                        the city during annual events like the Colmar
                        International Festival, Alsace's wine fair
                        and Colmar's Christmas market.

                    <h2>Crème brûlée</h2>
                    <p>
                        This traditional egg custard dessert consists of egg yolks,
                        cream, sugar, and vanilla, with a hard, burnt, toffee crust.
                        The combination is cooked,
                        transferred into ramekins, poached in a bain-marie, then well
                        chilled. The chilled custard is typically set in wide, flat dishes,
                        and is then topped with brown sugar which is either caramelized
                        under a broiler or with a blowtorch.

                        The origins of the dish are quite unclear, and England, Spain,
                        and France all claim to have invented it. However, most food historians
                        agree that custards were popular as far back as the Middle Ages, and
                        recipes for custards circulated throughout Europe for centuries. </p>

                    <h2>Macarons</h2>
                    <p> These small, round, sweet meringue-based cookie sandwiches
                        with filling in the middle are light and crunchy on the
                        outside and chewy in the middle. Macarons, which first
                        appeared in Italy in 1533
                        (albeit without the filling), got their

                        name from the Italian word maccherone, which means fine dough.

                        They were originally made for the marriage of the
                        Duke of Orléans, who later became King Henry II of
                        France. Food historians credit Pierre Desfontaines
                        as the inventor of the macaron. He was the first to
                        fill the cookies with a creamy ganache and stick them
                        together, turning the humble almond cookie into the
                        versatile treat we know today. </p>

                    <h2>Baguette</h2>
                    <p>Probably the most iconic image of France,
                        this long, light, airy bread with its
                        characteristically crispy crust dates back
                        to the 19th century, when wheat and white breads were no longer a privilege
                        of the rich. Baguettes were made even before
                        the invention of their name.

                        The word baguette first entered use in 1920,
                        derived from the Latin root baculum, meaning
                        stick or staff, which became baccheto in Italian.
                        Baguettes were first baked as long, wide loaves
                        of bread, but a 1920 law prevented workers from
                        beginning work before 4AM, making it impossible
                        for bakers to finish baking the bread in time for breakfast. </p>

                    <p>
                        These flaky, golden-colored, crescent-shaped pastries are best made with pure butter and a
                        slightly
                        sweet yeast dough. If made properly,
                        the yellow-white interior should be just
                        the slightest bit elastic when pulled from the center,
                        ready to be covered with a pad of butter or some fresh jam.

                        Experts agree that the croissant was heavily influenced
                        by Austrian kipfels. This pastry originated in 1683 as a
                        celebration of the Austrian victory over the Ottoman Empire,
                        its shape supposedly mimicking the crescent moon found on the Turkish flag.

                        Quiche is usually very filling and high in calories, making it a frequent choice for parties and
                        buffet tables.

                        It can be served either hot or cold, and is traditionally cut into slices. Numerous varieties of

                <p class="texxt">With a whopping 9.6 million visitors in 2019,
                     the famous Louvre is the most visited museum in the world.
                      Located in the heart of Paris, the magnificent museum is home
                       to around 38,000 works of art and artifacts dating back to prehistoric times. These include the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo,
                     and IM Pei’s famous glass Louvre Pyramid which sits in the 
                     courtyard. Unsurprising, the Louvre is one of the busiest places to visit in Paris.

                <p class="texxt">Thousands of tourists flock to the beautiful
                    Fontana di Trevi where they throw coins for luck – a whopping
                    €3,000 worth of change each day. In 2016, an estimated €1.4 million
                    (US$1.5 million) was thrown in the fountain. The money was
                    collected and donated to charity, including subsidizing a
                    supermarket in Rome for those in need.
                    The tradition of throwing coins into the fountain stems
                    from a local legend that says if you toss a coin from your
                    right hand over your left shoulder, you will return to Rome
                    one day. The 1950s film “Three Coins in the Fountain” inspired
                    a second legend that says if you toss two more coins, you’ll
                    find a new romance and have a gorgeous Roman wedding.

            <h3> <strong>3.</strong> THE FIRST PUBLIC SCREENING OF A MOVIE WAS BY THE FRENCH LUMIERE IN 1895</h3>
            <div class=" contextss">
                <p class="texxt1">The Lumière brothers, Auguste Marie 
                    Louis Nicolas and Louis Jean, were famous for their
                     Cinématographe motion picture system and the short 
                     films they produced between 1895 and 1905. The famed 
                     duo held the world’s first pub­lic movie screening on
                      December 28, 1895, at the Grand Café in Paris. Their
                       directorial debut was La sortie des ouvriers de l’usine
                        Lumière (Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory).
                         The five-second-long black-and-white film simply 
                         showed workers leaving the Lumière factory and 
                         left the audience
                     completely flabbergasted. In 1895, Louis Lumière
                      supposedly said that cinema is “an invention without 
                      a future.” Oh, how little did he know…

                    Now here’s an interesting fact about France. 
                    The word ‘camouflage’ actually comes from the 
                    French verb meaning ‘to make up for the stage’. 
                    This is because the French Army was the first to
                     create a dedicated camouflage unit in 1915.
                      Guns and vehicles were painted by artists called 
                      camofleurs. The following year, the British Army followed suit and established
                     its own camouflage section under the command
                      of Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Wyatt. It was
                       known as the Special Works Park RE (Royal Engineers).

            <h3> <strong>5.</strong>LOUIS XIX WAS THE KING OF FRANCE FOR JUST 20 MINUTES, THE SHORTEST EVER REIGH</h3>
            <div class=" contextss">
                <p class="texxt">
                    Yes, you read the right. The French king
                     only enjoyed 20 minutes of royal fame 
                     after his father Charles X abdicated,
                      leaving him to ascend the French throne
                       in July 1830. After this brief period,
                        Louis-Antoine also abdicated in favor 
                        of his nephew, the Duke of Bordeaux.
                         This makes him the joint shortest reigning 
                         monarch in history. He shares the astonishing
                          record with Crown Prince 
                    Luís Filipe, who technically became king of
                     Portugal after his father was assassinated.
                      But he also died from a wound 20 minutes later.
