<h2>The Taj Mahal, Agra</h2>
 <p>
Perhaps India's most recognizable building, 
the Taj Mahal is also the world's most famous 
testimony to the power of love. Named after 
Mumtaz Mahal, the favorite wife of Emperor 
Shah Jahan, this most beautiful of mausoleums 
was begun upon her death in 1631 and took 20,000 
workmen until 1648 to complete.
Incorporating many elements of Islamic design including 
arches, minarets, an onion-shaped dome, and black calligraphy 
inlaid around the entrance, the Taj Mahal is largely 
constructed of white marble. Adding to its splendor are 
delicate inlaid floral patterns and precious and semi-precious 
stones such as jade, lapis lazuli, diamonds, and mother of pearl.
The best time to visit is either at dawn or dusk when the 
atmosphere is brilliantly altered by the change in lighting. 
If possible, try to catch a view of the Taj Mahal's reflection 
from the far bank of the Yamuna River-it makes for a memorable 
(and safe) selfie.</p>

<h2>The Holy City of Varanasi</h2>
<p> Dating back to the 8th century BC, Varanasi 
is one of the oldest still inhabited cities in the 
world. A major pilgrimage center for Hindus, this holy 
city has long been associated with the mighty Ganges 
River, one of the faith's most important religious symbols.
Varanasi offers many reasons to visit, not least of them 
the chance to explore the Old Quarter adjacent to the Ganges 
where you'll find the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, built in 1780. 
The New Vishwanath Temple with its seven separate temples is 
also of interest.
Bathing in the Ganges is of great importance to Hindus, and 
numerous locations known as "ghats" feature stairways leading 
to the water where the faithful bathe before prayers. The largest 
are Dasashvamedh Ghat and Assi Ghat. The latter, at the confluence 
of the Ganges and Asi rivers, is considered particularly holy.
Also worth seeing is Banaras Hindu University, established 
in 1917 and noted for its massive library with more than a 
million books, and the superb Bharat Kala Bhavan museum 
featuring fine collections of miniature paintings, sculptures, 
palm-leaf manuscripts, and local history exhibits.</p>

<h2>Mumbai: The Gateway of India</h2>
<p>Standing an impressive 26 meters tall and overlooking 
the Arabian Sea, the iconic Gateway of India is a must-see when 
in Mumbai. Built to commemorate the arrival of King George V and 
his wife Queen Mary in 1911, this stunning piece of architecture 
was opened with much pomp and ceremony in 1924 and was, for a 
while, the tallest structure in the city.
Constructed entirely of yellow basalt and concrete and 
notable for its Indo-Saracenic design, the Gateway of 
India was also the scene of a rather less jubilant 
procession of British soldiers in 1948 when India 
gained its independence. These days, the huge archway 
provides a stunning backdrop that is as popular among 
locals as it is tourists.
Hot Tip: After visiting the Gateway of India, pop over to 
the adjacent Taj Mahal Palace and Tower for a delectable High 
Tea, a fun thing to do in Mumbai since this lovely luxury hotel 
opened in 1903.</p>

<h2>Mysore Palace</h2>
<p>
The sprawling city of Mysore is a delight to 
explore thanks to its eclectic mix of fine old 
colonial architecture; regal Indian palaces; and 
lush, well-manicured gardens. While those inclined 
towards shopping will enjoy spending time in the 
city's famous silk and sandalwood bazaars, the main 
attraction is magnificent Mysore Palace.
Completely rebuilt in 1897 after a devastating fire, this 
beautiful three-storied palace features highlights such as 
its elegant square towers and domes; the many ornate ceilings 
and pillars in Durbar Hall; and the splendid Marriage Pavilion, 
with its glazed floor tiles, stunning stained glass, artworks, 
and displays of jewelry. It's also where, on special occasions, 
the exquisite Golden Throne is exhibited.
For a real treat, be sure to catch one of the splendid light 
displays held each Sunday and during holidays, when the palace 
is illuminated by more than 90,000 lights. A fun way to explore 
the palace's massive grounds and gardens is as part of a cycle 
tour, available free once inside.

<h2> The Red Fort, New Delhi</h2>
<p>Built by Shah Jahan in 1648 as the seat of Mughal 
power – a role it maintained until 1857 – the magnificent 
crescent-shaped Red Fort in New Delhi, named after the stunning 
red sandstone used in its construction, covers a vast area of 
more than two square kilometers, all of it surrounded by a 
large moat.
Highlights include its two largest gates: the impressive 
Lahore Gate (the fort's main entrance) and the elaborately 
decorated Delhi Gate, once used by the emperor for ceremonial 
processions.
A fun part of a visit is exploring Chatta Chowk, a 
17th-century covered bazaar selling everything from 
jewelry to silk garments, as well as souvenirs and food 
items. While you can explore the fort yourself, guided 
tours are offered and provide a fascinating insight into 
the life and times of the Shah, including a peek into the 
stunning white marble Hall of Public Audiences (Diwan-i-Am) 
where he received his subjects.
Hot Tip: Try to stick around for the sound and light show 
held each evening featuring important events in the fort's 
history.</p>

<h2>Amer Fort, Jaipur</h2>
<p>Amer Fort (often also spelt "Amber") was built as 
a fortified palace in 1592 by Maharaja Man Singh I and 
has long served as the capital of Jaipur. Carved high up 
into the hillside, the fort is accessible on foot via a 
steep climb or by shuttle rides from the town below 
(better still, let an elephant do the work).
Highlights include Jaleb Chowk, the first courtyard, 
with its many decorated elephants, and the Shila Devi 
Temple, dedicated to the goddess of war. Also of note is 
the adjoining Hall of Public Audience (Diwan-i-Am) with its 
finely decorated walls and terraces frequented by monkeys.
Other highlights include Sukh Niwas (the Hall of Pleasure) 
with its many flowerbeds and a channel once used to carry 
cooling water, and the Temple of Victory (Jai Mandir), 
notable for its many decorative panels, colorful ceilings, 
and excellent views over the palace and the lake below.
Just above Amer Fort is Jaigarh Fort, built in 1726 by Jai 
Singh and featuring tall lookout towers, formidable walls, 
and the world's largest wheeled cannon. Be sure to also spend 
time wandering the walled Old City of Jaipur with its three 
fully restored gates and splendid bazaars, as well as the 
delightful City Palace, a massive complex of courtyards, 
gardens, and buildings.

<h2>The Beaches of Goa</h2>
<p>
Long known within India as the "go-to" 
destination for those seeking a great beach 
holiday, Goa's beautiful western coastline, 
overlooking the Arabian Sea, has only recently 
been discovered by tourists from overseas. Goa's 
more than 60 miles of coastline is home to some of 
the world's loveliest beaches, each with their own 
particular appeal.
For those looking for peace and quiet, isolated 
Agonda Beach is a good choice, while Calangute Beach 
is by far the most commercial and crowded. For those 
in search of posh resorts, yoga getaways, and spa 
vacations, the beaches of Mandrem, Morjim, and Ashwem 
are fashionable among wealthy Indians and Westerners 
alike. Palolem is another one of Goa's popular beaches 
in a beautiful setting.
While in Goa, be sure to visit the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife 
Sanctuary. This superb attraction is home to thick forests 
and plenty of fauna, including deer, monkeys, elephants, 
leopards, tigers, and black panthers, as well as India's 
famous king cobras, and some 200 species of birds.
Also worth a visit is Divar Island, accessed by ferry from 
Old Goa. Highlights include Piedade, a typical Goan village 
and home to the Church of Our Lady of Compassion with its 
interesting stucco work, Baroque plaster decorations, and 
altars, as well as stunning views of the surrounding countryside.

 <h2>Periyar National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, Madurai</h2>
<p>One of South India's most popular tourist attractions, 
Periyar National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is centered 
around a lake built by British engineers in 1895 for 
irrigation and to provide water to the city of Madurai.
Established in 1934, this beautiful park is home to 
numerous species of mammals, including a large free-roaming 
Indian elephant population, wild boar, otters, the lion-tailed 
macaque, and more than 20 Bengal tigers. Bird-watching is a 
popular activity with frequent sightings of species such as 
darters, storks, kingfishers, hornbills, and racket-tailed 
drongos, along with many interesting varieties of butterflies.
The best ways to enjoy the park's splendid mountain scenery 
are to take a lake cruise or guided jungle walk, the latter 
allowing visitors a chance to come face to face with elephant 
herds and observe other wildlife from watchtowers and viewing 
platforms.</p>

<h2>Mahabodhi Temple, Bodhgaya</h2>
<p>Venice is a city, which feels like a dream! 
Bodhgaya, considered the world's holiest Buddhist site, 
attracts thousands of visitors each year, all drawn to 
participate with the resident monks in meditation and prayer.
The focal point of this place of pilgrimage is stunning Mahabodhi 
Temple, built next to the very spot where Buddha came to 
Enlightenment and formulated his philosophy on life. Constructed 
in the 6th century and restored numerous times since, the temple 
is topped with a beautiful pyramidal spire and houses a large 
gilded statue of Buddha.
Also of interest is the site's pipal tree, a descendant of the 
original bodhi tree where Buddha meditated for seven days after 
the Enlightenment, said to be among the oldest and most venerated 
trees in the world (you'll know you've found it when you spot the 
red sandstone slab marking the spot).

<h2>Masque, Mumbai</h2>
<p>
The Masque team travels far and wide, from 
the forests of Kashmir to the shores of Goa, 
to bring back hyperlocal ingredients from across 
the country to their restaurant in Mahalaxmi, 
where these ingredients undergo seemingly magical 
transformations before they arrive at your table. 
Born and brought up in Mumbai, chef Varun Totlani 
started off at Masque as commis chef and rose the 
ranks to become head chef in 2022. Along with 
founder and entrepreneur Aditi Dugar, the restaurant’s 
10-course seasonal chef’s tasting menus marry tradition 
and innovation, transforming homegrown produce into 
fine-dining dishes. So, a Lonavala inspired chocolate 
fudge gets topped with kachampuli ice cream, Coorg’s 
pandi curry is made with jackfruit sausage, and the winter 
favorite Gujarati snack ponkh bhel is zhuzhed up with Goan 
seaweed.

<h2>Kulfi</h2>
<p> Kulfi is a classic Indian ice cream made with slowly

results in a loss of volume, it makes up for it with a delicious, 
nutty, caramelized flavor. The ice cream is characterized by its 
unusual, conical shape, a result of using traditional, 
special molds with tight-fitting lids.
Kulfi is usually flavored with ingredients such as pistachio, 
rose water, green tea, and saffron. It is believed to have been

<h3> <strong>1.</strong>THE FIRST COUNTRY TO MINE AND LEAD DIAMOND PRODUCTION</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt1">Per the records, India has been the only 
source of diamonds in the world for over 1000 years since 
the 4th century BC. This is one of the proudest facts about 
India. The diamonds were mined from the alluvial deposits of 
the Krishna Nagar Delta. It was not till the 18th century that 
diamonds were found in Brazil. Even though India is not the 
major producer of diamonds in the world since the 1900s, 
diamond mining is still taking place. The most popular regions 
for industrial-scale diamond mining are Panna in Madhya Pradesh, 
followed by Golconda in Andhra Pradesh, and Mahasamund in 
Chhattisgarh.

<h3> <strong>2.</strong>INDIAN WEDDINGS ARE A COLOURFUL OCCASION</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<img class="texxt-images" src="images/interesfact3.webp" height="400px" alt="">
 <p class="texxt">A woman may be forbidden from housework while any colour 
from the bridal mendhi (henna) is on her hands. Indian weddings 
are often colourful extended occasions that can last for anything 
from 3 days to a full week. The ceremonies start with the Ganesh 
pooja, Usually, a private ceremony that takes place with the 
couple and their close families to honour good fortune, followed 
by the mendhi ceremony the next day where henna patterns are 
painted on the bride and her female friends and family. 
That evening, there's often the sangeet- a musical night to 
welcome all the wedding guests, with the main ceremony and 
reception happening on the third day.

<h3> <strong>3.</strong>INDIA IS HOME TO THE FAMOUS HOLI FESTIVAL </h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt">The Holi Festival is a Hindu festival 
that takes place over two days. It originated in India 
and celebrates love, spring and new life. Holi is usually 
celebrated in March as it marks the end of winter and the 
arrival of spring.
During the first day of Holi, people gather around a bonfire 
to celebrate good triumphing over evil. The second day of 
the festival is the one most people will know, and includes 
lots of colourful perfumed powder, paint, water pistols and 
balloons. People launch all these things at each other in the 
streets, which ultimately creates a colour bloodbath. For this 
reason, the Holi festival is also known as ‘the festival of 
colours’. Over the course of the two days, the festival celebrates 
the legend of Holika and Prahland, and the Hindu god Krishna.

<p class="texxt">
When it comes to national animals & symbols; India’s is

sadly an endangered species. However, thanks to conservation 
efforts the number of tigers in India are finally increasing! 
Since 2006, it’s estimated that the amount of tigers in the 
wild has doubled, which gives us great hope for this beautiful 
species. Now India is home to around 3/4 of the world’s tiger 
population, which is pretty special.
There are plenty of national parks throughout India where tigers 
can be spotted, and if you are lucky enough to catch a glimpse 
of one, then it’s a pretty special experience! Some of the most 
popular national parks to visit include Ranthambore National Park, 
Bandhavgarh National Park and Tadoba National Park.

<p class="texxt">
One of the most amazing facts about India is its contribution 
to the world spice market. Over 70% of different varieties of 
spices in the world are grown in India, with the most popular 
spices, namely cardamom, cinnamon, saffron, turmeric, nutmeg, 
vanilla, and cloves. Besides this, India is also the largest 
consumer of spices in the world. No wonder Indian kitchens are 
stacked with versatile spices that are used in everyday cooking 
without fail. Also, there is mention of spices to cure common 
ailments in the Vedas, which is an important part of Indian 
culture. If you ever want to get immersed in aromas and a complex 
labyrinth of spice lanes, then Khari Baoli in Delhi is the place 
to visit. Touted as the largest spice market in Asia, it is 
overwhelmingly beautiful and a delight to the senses. However, 
do take a guide along with you if it is your first time.
