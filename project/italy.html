<h2>Colosseum, Rome</h2>
 <p>
    This huge amphitheater, the largest of its kind 
    ever built by the Roman Empire and the largest 
    of their constructions to survive, remained a 
    model for sports facilities right up to modern 
    times. Built by Vespasian in 72 CE and enlarged
     by the addition of a fourth story by his son, 
     Titus, the Colosseum was a venue for public 
     spectacles and shows - even mock sea battles.
    A wooden floor that was 83 by 48 meters covered 
    two additional underground stories with tunnels, 
    rooms, cells, and passages that provided space for 
    gladiators, workers, wild animals, and storage.
    Today, the structure stands in stark contrast 
    to the modern development that surrounds it 
    and is a prominent reminder of ancient times
     and the extensive history of Rome.
    Tip to parents: The Colosseum is one of the most 
    popular places for families in Rome, and you can
     make a visit even more memorable for your kids
      by enrolling them in a gladiator lesson. They 
      (and you) can don replica gladiator helmets and 
      shields and learn swordplay with wooden swords.</p>

<h2>Tuscany</h2>
<p> The sunlight in Tuscany is buttery
     yellow and seems to have a syrupy
      quality as it rolls over the
       countryside’s gentle hills, 
       vineyards, cypress trees, and 
       sleepy farmhouses. For many, this is the 
       quintessential landscape of Italy.
    That sun and those hills support farms and 
    wineries that produce everything from fragrant
     truffles to blockbuster wines like chianti.
      You can easily spend your entire time in 
      Tuscany simply wandering from one transcendent
       meal to another, with pauses for wine tastings
        while you admire the views. If you prefer to 
        get more hands on, we can arrange truffle hunts, 
        cooking classes, and guided tours with a culinary slant.
    The gastronomy also influences where you stay in 
    Tuscany. There are plenty of elegant hotels and
     stately palazzos, if you like, but most visitors 
     stay in an agritourismo — traditional farmhouses where
      you can eat meals that give a whole new meaning
       to farm-to-fork. Many have their own small 
       vineyards attached, too.</p>

<h2>Bologna</h2>
<p>Nestled in the fertile Po Valley, Bologna is 
    home to both Europe’s oldest university and 
    some of its most renowned cuisine. In the 
    heart of the city, the well-preserved 
    medieval Piazza Maggiore reflects the 
    region’s historical wealth with its grand 
    red-brick buildings, many balconies, and 
    porticoed streets. A guided walking tour 
    offers insights into how the architecture 
    reflects the city’s history.
    To its east, you can wander through Quadrilatero,
     a grid of narrow streets packed with traditional 
     food stalls and restaurants. The city has many
      nicknames, including La Grassa, or The Fat One,
       thanks to Bologna’s rich cuisine, which is a 
       result of the agricultural wealth of the
        surrounding countryside.
    Bologna’s many restaurants reflect its culinary 
    tradition. But if you want a more hands-on approach,
     you might consider a cooking class or a gastronomic 
     tour to meet some of the farmers and artisans who
      create renowned ingredients like Parmigiano-Reggiano,
       balsamic vinegar, and air-dried prosciutto.</p>

<h2> Sicily: A Melting Pot of Cultures</h2>
<p>For the best things to do in Italy right now,

<h2>Pompeii</h2>
<p>The archaeological site of Pompeii is considered 
among the most important and famous  in the whole world. 
At the moment, it is excavated for about four-fifths of 
its entire urban area, and it represents a treasure of a 
priceless historical value, as it’s the one and only 
excavation (along with that of Herculaneum) that can 
give back to the visitor an ancient Roman town in a 
condition of perfect preservation.
The eruption of Mount Vesuvius on that tragic morning 
of 79 AD buried Pompeii under 10 meters of ashes and 
volcanic materials, and because of that the city has 
remained intact over the centuries till the present days.
With a guided tour of Pompeii you will feel like traveling 
back in time, as you can breathe the atmosphere of public 
life in ancient times, between the ruins of private Roman 
residences, taverns, bakeries and markets.

<h2>Museums in Florence</h2>
<p>
Known as the “Cradle of Renaissance”, Florence is one 
of the art and cultural centers of the world. The city 
houses two of the most important museums, such as the Uffizi 
Gallery and the Accademia Gallery.
The Uffizi Gallery is one of the most visited places in 
Italy, with over 1.5 million visitors each year, and among 
the oldest and most important art museums in Europe. Located 
on the top floor of a U-shaped building, the Gallery houses an 
artistic heritage of inestimable value, which includes thousands 
of paintings, from Medieval to contemporary times, including The 
“Birth of Venus by Botticelli”, as well as works of Caravaggio, 
Michelangelo, Piero della Francesca and so on.
The Galleria dell'Accademia is mainly famous for the 
universally-famous David, a magnificent giant statue, 
created by Michelangelo in 1504, but it also houses several 
interesting collections of masterpieces, such as the 
"Rape of the Sabine Women".
The best way to visit those museums skipping the long lines 
is with a guided tour that includes both museums in one day!

<h2>Venice</h2>
<p>Venice is a city, which feels like a dream! 
The alluring blue of the canals, the fine mist that 
sometimes covers the city’s outer layer, the moment of 
turning around a corner and witnessing striking all-white 
church – it all adds up to your experience when you visit Venice.

UNESCO World Heritage Site. No matter which part of Venice you

masterpieces, moody churches, classic Italian delicacies, and 
contemporary art.One of the best ways to explore the city is 
to take a walk around. Explore the narrow alleyways, cross 
hundreds of bridges, and get inspired by some of the magnificent

<h2>Pizza</h2>
 <p>
Number one on our list of the best traditional foods 
in Italy has to be pizza. Everyone knows what pizza 
is, it needs no introduction, but what you probably 
know as pizza isn’t quite the same as in Italy. Pizza 
has been around the Italian Peninsula for centuries, 
but it was in 1889 when Queen Margherita of Savoy 
visited the city of Naples that the famous pizza 
Margherita was born. The story goes that the queen 
was tired of French cuisine and that she summoned 
Raffaele Esposito, a well-known pizza-maker, to 
create an original pizza for her. Queen Margherita 
approved of the pizza consisting of tomato sauce, 
mozzarella and basil. Immediately after this, Raffaele 
Esposito named his pizza the Margherita and asked the 
Queen for her royal approval.
In Italy, pizza is fresh, simple, and of a decent size, 
making each ingredient stand out on its own. There are two 
types of Italian pizza: Neapolitan pizza “pizza Napoletana”, 
which is thicker and smaller, also known as Naples-style 
pizza, and Roman pizza “pizza Romana”, which originates from 
Rome and is thinner, crispier, and larger.</p>

<h2>Gelato</h2>
<p> No, gelato is not just ice cream, although it may 
look similar, it is quite different to what is commonly 
known as ice cream. Gelato has way less fat than ice cream 
and a stronger taste since it’s not mixed with water and air. 
Gelato is made with fresh ingredients only, making it unable to 
store for long periods of time. Also, it is stored and served 
less cold than ice cream, giving the gelato a smoother texture 
and making it more refreshing while enjoying it walking through 
the streets of Rome. One of the best desserts to enjoy during 
the summer… and even during the winter!
If you’ve made it this far, you’re probably craving an authentic 
Italian feast, probably you are looking for a place that will 
serve the traditional foods in Italy with authentic preparations 
and full understanding of its gastronomy by type and even by 
region. NOI, an Italian restaurant in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico 
like no other. Its unique decoration with hints of contemporary 
art will make you appreciate your Italian culinary experience in 
a whole different way. At NOI you will find a variety of pizzas, 
risottos, and pastas, among many other classic Italian dishes, 
presented on a menu specially created by our star chef that will 
offer the best dishes from each Italian region.</p>

<h2>Pasta Alla Carbonara</h2>

Italians love pasta and it can be very hard to choose 
just one pasta from the huge variety of pasta dishes. 
However, pasta carbonara is a real classic. It is 
traditionally made of spaghetti, eggs, black pepper, 
pecorino cheese and cured Italian meats such as Pancetta 
or Guanciale.
The recipe can have many variations as well with other 
types of pasta such as fettuccine or linguine as well 
as different cheeses like parmesan. However, the authentic 
Roman pasta alla carbonara is one of the city’s treasures 
and one that you can conveniently find across the city.

<h2>Digestivo</h2>
<p>The term “digestivo” or “digestive” does not refer to 
one drink, but a class of drinks that are enjoyed after a 
big meal with the aim of settling the stomach and helping 
you feel not-quite-so-full. Drinking them dates back to the 
Middle Ages, when people all over Europe believed in the 
medicinal properties of alcohol mixed with sugar and herbs.
Although the doctors are still out on the medical benefits 
of drinking medium to strong liquors after a meal, the fact 
remains that you cannot say you have enjoyed a real Italian 
meal unless you top it off with a shot of the hard stuff.
Popular digestives include limoncello, grappa, amaro, cynar, 
amaretto, and if you’re feeling brave, sambuca, which has enough 
alcohol to make a horse giddy. If you step off the beaten track 
in Italy you will also discover all types of nice post dinner 
tipples made from local fruits and herbs. Don’t be shy, they are 
always worth a sip.</p>

<h2>Top 5 interesting facts about Italy</h2>
</div>
</div>

<div class="fact1">
<h3> <strong>1.</strong> ALL THREE OF EUROPE'S ACTIVE VOLCANOES ARE IN ITALY </h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt">We already knew Italy is a smokin’ 
hot country, but did you know Italy is a hotspot for 
volcanic activity? All three of Europe’s active volcanoes, 
including Etna, Vesuvius and Stromboli.
Mount Etna is located on the island of Sicily. It last 
erupted in 2018, but you can see a plume of white steam 
rising from the peak. Mount Stromboli is currently active, 
although it’s located on its own island off the coast of Sicily.
Meanwhile, the notorious Mount Vesuvius is located in Naples 
and hasn’t erupted since 1944 when it caused major destruction. 
The volcano is also responsible for one of the most catastrophic 
eruptions in history in 79 B.C. You can still see the destruction 
caused by the volcano in the ancient city of Pompeii.

<div class="fact1">
<h3> <strong>2.</strong>TOURISTS THROW €3,000 INTO THE TREVI FOUNTAIN EVERY DAY </h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<img class="texxt-images" src="images/images74.jpg" height="400px" alt="">
 <p class="texxt">Thousands of tourists flock to the beautiful 
Fontana di Trevi where they throw coins for luck – a whopping 
€3,000 worth of change each day. In 2016, an estimated €1.4 million 
(US$1.5 million) was thrown in the fountain. The money was 
collected and donated to charity, including subsidizing a 
supermarket in Rome for those in need.
The tradition of throwing coins into the fountain stems 
from a local legend that says if you toss a coin from your 
right hand over your left shoulder, you will return to Rome 
one day. The 1950s film “Three Coins in the Fountain” inspired 
a second legend that says if you toss two more coins, you’ll 
find a new romance and have a gorgeous Roman wedding.

<div class="fact1">
<h3> <strong>3.</strong>ROME IS OVER 2,000 YEARS OLD - BUT ITALY IS ONE OF EUROPE'S YOUNGEST COUNTRIES</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt1">Italy is less than 200 years old; 
However, the capital city of Rome is ancient. The city 
was founded in 753 BC and has a history dating back 28 
centuries. The Romans named the city after the Roman Empire, 
which began in 27 BC and ruled over much of Europe and North 
Africa until 395 AD.
The region was then divided into separate states, which didn’t 
unify until 1861. That’s when the Kingdom of Italy we know today 
was founded.

<h3> <strong>4.</strong>ITALY IS ALSO HOME TO THE WORLD'S SMALLEST COUNTRY</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<img class="texxt-images" src="images/images79.jpg" height="350px" alt="">
<p class="texxt">
A country within a country – and a city? Yes, it’s true! 
Home to the Pope, Saint Peter’s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, 
and famous museums, the Vatican City (Stato della città del 
Vaticano) is in Rome and is a city-state meaning it’s a country 
in its own right.Covering just 1,000 acres, the Vatican became a 
sovereign state in 1929, with the Pope as its head of state. 
It even has its own system of government, law, and military 
(the Swiss Guards).
What’s more, Italy also holds the fifth smallest country in 
the world within its borders: the microstate San Marino. 
Located in Italy’s northern mountains, it covers just over 
15,120 acres and is home to around 33,500 inhabitants. 
Founded in 301 AD, this small country is the oldest sovereign 
state in the world.
 </p>

<h3> <strong>5.</strong>ITALIAN ISN'T THE COUNTRY'S ONLY LANGUAGE</h3>
<div class=" contextss">                                                                       
<p class="texxt">
As an international, being able to speak Italian 
will ease your integration. However, if you want to 
get in with the locals, you might want to pick up a 
few words of the dialect of the area.
Italy has some 28 distinct dialects in the country. 
For example, you might hear Sicilian in Calabria and 
Palermo, Venetian in Venice, Apulian in Bari and Matera, 
or Ligurian in Genoa.
If that’s not enough, you can also expect to hear certain 
areas of Italy speaking German as their main language. 
You can hear it spoken in the Autonomous Province of 
Bolzano and surrounding areas close to the Austrian border.
