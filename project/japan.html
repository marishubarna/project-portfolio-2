<h2>Totoro Café and Bakery</h2>
 <p>
If you’re a Ghibli’s fan thinking of visiting Japan,
one of the places where you should definitely visit
is Shiro-hige’s Cream Puff Factory, in Setagaya (Tokyo).
Setagaya is a residential area near Shinjuku popular 
for its more bohemian and retro-style coffee shops 
and stores in Shimo Kitazawa Shirohige Cream Puff Factory
The Studio Ghibli is probably the most famous animation 
company in the world, and they don’t need a presentation.
Hayao Miyazaki, the founder and direct of the studio, is 
world renowned and admired by critics and animation fans.
The souvenirs or merchandising of the Studio Ghibli films
are the most wanted by foreigners as well as Japanese
and the tickets of the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka are sold 
out after a few minutes of going on sale.
But although there are all kinds of objects about the films 
of Miyazaki and his team (towels, glasses, stuffed animals,
watches, etc.) there’s only one bakery in the world with 
official permission to make sweets (cream puff, cookies, 
cakes, etc) with the shape of Totoro, one of the most
iconic and popular characters of Studio Ghibli.</p>

<h2>R.a.a.g.f Rabbit Café</h2>
<p>Visitors are encouraged to pet, play with and feed 
the dozen or so rabbits "on staff" at this small 
backstreet cafe. Several different breeds are represented,
and most of them seem to be quite lively
(especially compared to typical residents of a cat cafe).
The cafe's interior space is relatively small - just three
tiny tables, with floor seating for visitors. The rabbits
take turns scampering about and spending time in their 
cages, with only a few running loose at any given time, 
although you can play with the ones in their cages too.
A dish of greens and shredded carrots for feeding the
rabbits is Y150, and coffee and soft drinks are included 
in the cover charge, which is Y700 for the first thirty
minutes or Y1100 for the first hour, plus Y550 for each 
additional thirty minutes.</p>

<h2>Osaka Castle</h2>
<p>
Osaka Castle (大坂城 or 大阪城, Ōsaka-jō) is
a Japanese castle in Chūō-ku, Osaka, Japan.
The castle is one of Japan's most famous
landmarks and it played a major role in
the unification of Japan during the 
sixteenth century of the Azuchi-Momoyama
period.The main keep of Osaka Castle is
situated on a plot of land roughly one 
square kilometre. It is built on two raised 
platforms of landfill supported by sheer 
walls of cut rock, using a technique 
called burdock piling, each overlooking 
a moat. The keep is five stories on the 
outside and eight stories on the inside 
and built atop a tall stone foundation 
to protect its occupants from attackers.
The main keep is surrounded by a series
of moats and defensive fortifications. 
The castle has two moats (an inner & outer). 
The inner castle moat lies within the castle
grounds and consists of two types: a wet 
(northern-easterly) and dry (south-westerly).
Outer moat meanwhile surrounds the 
entire castle premise, denotes the 
castle's outer limits, and consists 
 of four individual water-filled sections,
each representing a cardinal direction 
(North, East, South, West).
The castle grounds, which cover approximately 
61,000 square metres (15 acres), contain the
following thirteen structures that were denoted
as "important cultural assets" by the Japanese.

<h2>Sushi</h2>
 <p>
Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or 
[sɯꜜɕi] ⓘ) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared
 rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar
and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients 
(ねた, neta), such as seafood — often raw — and 
vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation 
vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi 
rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi
(酢飯).
The creator of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya 
Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most 
known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed 
 vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period 
(1603–1867). It was the fast food of the chōnin class 
in the Edo period.
Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice,
though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain
rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as 
squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab 
meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often 
served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy 
sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are
popular garnishes for the dish.   
Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a dish that 
consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat,
without sushi rice.</p>

<h2>Anmitsu</h2>
<p> Anmitsu (あんみつ, rarely 餡蜜) is a Japanese dessert 
that dates to the Meiji era.
It is made of small cubes of agar jelly, a white
translucent jelly made from red algae. The agar is 
dissolved with water (or fruit juice such as apple juice)
to make the jelly. It is served in a bowl with sweet
azuki bean paste or anko (the an part of anmitsu), 
boiled peas, often gyūhi and a variety of fruits such 
as peach slices, mikan, pieces of pineapples, 
and cherries. The anmitsu usually comes with a 
small pot of sweet black syrup, or mitsu (the mitsu
 part of anmitsu) which one pours onto the jelly
before eating. Anmitsu is usually eaten with a 
spoon and fork.
A few variations on this dessert do exist. Mitsumame is
anmitsu without bean paste, the mame meaning the peas
that are served with the syrup and agar jelly instead.
Cream anmitsu is anmitsu with ice cream on top.
Shiratama dango are also commonly used as toppings.</p>

<h2>Imagawayaki</h2>

Imagawayaki (今川焼き) is a Japanese dessert
often found at Japanese festivals as well 
as outside Japan, in countries such as Taiwan 
and South Korea. It is made of batter in a 
special pan (similar to a waffle iron but 
without the honeycomb pattern), and filled 
with sweet azuki bean paste, although it is
becoming increasingly popular to use a wider
variety of fillings such as vanilla custard,
different fruit custards and preserves,
curry, different meat and vegetable fillings,
potato and mayonnaise. Imagawayaki are
similar to dorayaki, but the latter are
two separate pancakes sandwiched around
the filling after cooking, and are often 
served cold.Imagawayaki were first sold near
the Kanda's Imagawabashi Bridge during the 
An'ei era (1772–1781) of the Edo period

<h2>Top 5 interesting facts about Japan</h2>

</div>

<div class="fact1">
<h3> <strong>1.</strong>OVER 80% OF THE COUNTRY IS MOUNTAINOUS</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt">Around 80% of Japan is covered in
mountains which makes it a pretty cool place 
to explore. There is an area in central Honshu 
that is known as “the roof of Japan” because 
the area has so many mountains that are over
3,000m high. Most of the mountains in Japan 
including the Japan Alps were created by the 
collision of the continental crust of Asia 
and the Pacific oceanic crust. This movement 
caused the land mass to uplift, And helped 
create Japan as we know it today. 
This mountainous terrain is home to over 100 
active volcanoes, with some of the most popular 
being Mount Fuji, Mount Aso and Sakurajima. That 
number makes up about 10% of all active volcanoes
in the world, which is mad! If you are an adrenaline
junkie and love wandering up volcanoes then Japan
is the country for you.

<h3> <strong>2.</strong>JAPANESE PEOPLE HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST LIFE EXPECTANCIES IN THE WORLD</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<img class="texxt-images" src="images/images15.jpeg" height="400px" alt="">
 <p class="texxt">Japan has one of the highest life expectancies in the
world, and is second only to Hong Kong. The average life expectancy 
in Japan is 84, which is 5 years longer than that of the U.S. Over 
28% of the Japanese population are aged 65 and older, which is the 
 highest proportion in the world. Japan also has over 70,000 people
 in the country that are over 100 years old. 
Japan actually has an island that is nicknamed 
“the island of longevity”. Okinawa is an 
archipelago made up of 160 islands, located 
in the east China Sea which is well known for 
it’s high life expectancy. Many people that
live on these islands live past 100 years of
age, and there is a very low level of
disease here too. The people here live very 
healthy and happy lives, and it is 
 attributed to the concept “ikigai” which
translates to “reason for being” and their 
healthy diet.

<h3> <strong>3.</strong>THERE IS A RABBIT ISLAND IN JAPAN</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt1">There is a little island in Japan called Okunoshima,
which is well known for being full of cute rabbits for you
to cuddle. The island is nicknamed rabbit island and has 
become a popular tourist attraction over the years. It
is estimated that there are as many as 1,000 rabbits 
wandering around the island, and that they thrived due 
to there being no natural predators on Okunoshima.
You can even buy food to feed the rabbits which is 
pretty cool. 
The island is located in the inland sea of Japan and
originally has a much darker history. Okunoshima was
originally used during World War II to test chemical 
weapons. During this period workers were given minimum
protective gear, which led to many people becoming
sick due to the exposure of these gases. Today you 
can learn all about the island’s history at the 
Poison Gas Museum. You can only get to Okunoshima 
by ferry, so make sure to research the ferry times 
before your trip. The island is roughly 4km in 
circumference and takes about an hour to wander
around by foot. If you are a nature lover, then
make sure you head to this spot!

Japan is one of the safest countries in the world,

look into moving here. The most common crimes here
include stealing a bicycle or umbrellas left 
outside the convenience store.
At the metro and trains, you can see
locals who take a nap while having
their phone in their hand or clearly 
visible.
It’s also not uncommon to see people walking 
around with their backpacks and bags open. Another
thing, people don’t even lock their homes all the 
time or their bicycles! That’s how safe it is in Japan.

<h3> <strong>5.</strong> JAPAN CONSISTS OF OVER 6,800 ISLANDS</h3>

<p class="texxt">
Japan is made up of over 6,800 islands, with
around 430 of them being inhabited. It is the
largest island country in East Asia and the
fourth largest in the world. Japan has four
main islands which is where most of the big 
cities are found, and these are Honshu, 
Hokkaido, Kyushu and Shikoku. Honshu is the 
largest island of Japan and is the most 
populated, with the capital city of Tokyo being
located here.
Originally these islands were attached to the
east coast of Asia, but 15 million years ago,
tectonic activity caused the islands to split 
off from the mainland. This tectonic movement
created the Sea of Japan as we know it today.
