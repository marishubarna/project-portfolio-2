<h2>London</h2>
<p> <strong>london</strong>
    London is easily the most
     popular and famous to visit in England,
      and for many good reasons. London is full of
       attractions, including historical sites,
        landmarks, art galleries, theatres, and
         museums. Your days visiting London will 
         be varied and action-packed. For example,
          you may spend a morning at the Natural History Museum, 
    an afternoon grabbing lunch and shopping at the
     market in Camden Borough, and an evening 
     watching a West End show.

<h2> Manchesterx</h2>
<p> <strong>Manchester</strong>
    Manchester was massively shaped
     by the Industrial Revolution and
      is widely claimed to be the world’s 
      first industrial city. Manchester was once 
      famous for textile production, the wealth
       from which was reinvested in the city’s
        development and into wealthy families.
         However, Manchester has outgrown its
     Revolution associations nowadays and is 
     now known as an entertaining weekend getaway 
     and sought-after place to live.</p>

<h2>Leeds</h2>
<p> <strong>Leeds</strong>
    Like Manchester, Leeds was 
    also massively influenced by 
    the Industrial Revolution, and 
    you’ll notice converted mill and 
    factory buildings in many of the
     nearby areas. Leeds is the third biggest 
    in England and is known for its hospitality, 
    small city center, and proximity to the
     Yorkshire Dales.</p>

     and rivers and streams, the Yorkshire 
     Dales National Park is a great place to

     on the iconic Three Peaks Challenge. </p>

<h2> Devon</h2>
<p>Famous for its spectacular 
    coastline, gorgeous beaches, and the 
    world-famous Devonshire Cream Tea, Devon is the 
    jewel of the South West. From the pretty Mediterranean-like
     beaches of Salcombe and beautiful white cliffs of Lyme
      Bay to Dartmoor National Park, one of the last great
       wildernesses in the UK, nature lovers will be truly
        in their element in this scenic county. Off the 
        coast, you’ll find Lundy Island, dubbed by some as

<h2>Causeway Coast</h2>
<p>On the north coast of Northern Ireland,
     the otherworldly Causeway Coast is home
      to the spectacular Giant’s Causeway. This 
      UNESCO World Heritage site is home to 40,000
       interlocking hexagonal basalt rocks that stretch 
       along the coastline. These were formed by volcanic
        action around six million years ago, but today
         form one of Northern Ireland’s most famous tourist
          attractions. You can explore the history of this natural 
          wonder at the
     visitor’s center. However, you may want 
     to take some waterproofs with you as it can 
     get pretty wet and windy up there!

<h2>The Lake District</h2>
<p>The mountainous Lake District is 
    England’s largest National Park, making 
    it one of the best places to visit in the 
    UK if you truly want to escape to nature.
     Home to Scafell Pike, England’s highest mountain,
      and Wastwater, its deepest lake, it’s easy to see
       why this UNESCO World Heritage Site has
        inspired so many great writers over the
         years. Indeed, both William Wordsworth
          and Beatrix Potter called the region home. 
    Featuring rugged moors, glacial ribbon lakes
     and rolling green valleys, the area offers
      plenty of outdoor pursuits, too.

 <h2> The Scottish Highlands</h2>
<p>Boasting vast, untouched landscapes,
     picturesque towns, and lush greenery, 
     the Scottish Highlands are undoubtedly
      one of the most beautiful places to visit
       in the UK. This remote region has provided 
       the backdrop for many iconic movies. The
        peaks of Glen Etive, for instance, feature
         in the James Bond movie, Skyfall, while 
         Harry Potter’s Hogwarts Express can be
          seen zipping over the impressive 21-arched 
          Glenfinnan Viaduct. Therefore, movie buffs will 
    no doubt enjoy following in the footsteps
     of their favorite Hollywood stars and 
     exploring the rugged beauty of the Highlands.

<h2>Norfolk</h2>
<p>Think sandy beaches, beautiful waterways, 
    laid-back villages, and busy market towns.
     Well, Norfolk is all that and more. Located 
     on the east coast of England, this quiet corner
      of the country is often overlooked by visitors 
      – but it shouldn’t be. The man-made Broads offer
       200 kilometers of beautiful waterways just waiting
        to be explored on a boat, canoe, kayak, or even a 
        bicycle. Along Norfolk’s
     northern coast, you’ll also find sweeping beaches,
      excellent seafood (try the famous Cromer Crab), 
      and plenty of wildlife.

<h2>Snowdonia</h2>

    Home to rugged mountain landscapes,
     glacial landforms, and the highest
      mountain in Wales, Snowdonia National
       Park is undoubtedly one of the best places
        to visit in the UK any time of year. The
         star of the show here is Mount Snowdon,
          which stands at 1,085 meters. While the 
          summit can be reached by several routes,
           many daytrippers choose to take the
     iconic train to the top. In fact, the Snowdon
      Mountain Railway has been transporting visitors
       up the mountain since 1896.

<h2>Fish and Chips</h2>
 <p>
    here are claims to the first chippie
     from Lancashire in the North and London
      in the South of England. No matter who may 
      have opened the first fish and chip shop, 
      the trade grew to feed a rapidly expanding
     population, reaching a staggering 35,000 shops
      in the 1930s and more than tripling since then.

    The Federation of Fish Friers in the U.K
    . claims that in 1995 the British consumed 
    300 million servings of fish and chips, equating
     to six servings for every man woman and child in 
     the country. The record for the largest number of 
     portions sold in one day by an independent fish
      and chip shop is over 4,000.</p>

<h2>Crumpets</h2>
<p>Crumpets are a griddled bread that
     falls somewhere between an English
      muffin and a pancake. Like an English muffin,
       they're full of tiny holes, but their loose
        batter more closely resembles that of a pancake.

    While crumpets and English muffins are similar in size
     and cooked on the stovetop, there are some key
      differences between the two breakfast and teatime 
      classics. Crumpets have an extremely airy, spongy 
      dough with lots of distinctive bubbles throughout
       and visible on top. English muffins, while also
        airy, are solid on both sides and are made to be
         split open and topped with butter or jam.</p>

<h2>Cup of Tea</h2>
<p>Tea was first brought to Britain in 
    the early 17th century by the East India Company.
     It was an expensive product and one only for the rich and 
     often kept under lock and key. Catherine of Braganza, wife of
      Charles II introduced the ritual of drinking teas to the English 
      Royal Court and the habit adopted by the aristocracy. The first tea shop for ladies opened
       in 1717 by Thomas
     Twining and slowly tea shops began to appear throughout 
     England making the drinking of teas available to everyone. </p>

    Mukaddes Yadikar’s restaurant near
    
    Walthamstow Central station opened in
     London in summer 2017. It was London’s
      first strictly Uyghur restaurant, and has
       become perhaps E17’s finest neighbourhood
        restaurant. Some points of advice: First, go
        
        with a group. Second, to start, go for the
         Chaomian, a stir-fry of short noodle snippets
          wokked with chunks of beef, spring onion, and
           tomato. Third, and most importantly, get the
            signature da pan ji (“big plate chicken”):
             a remarkably deep, savoury, and spicy chicken
              and potato stew, teeming with Sichuan
     peppercorns, served with flat hand-pulled noodles. 
     This is a warm, homely, and treasured space to 
     eat in east London.

<h2>Sunday Roast</h2>
<p>One of the most historic and famous foods to try in London is the Sunday Roast. This 
    sumptuous meal originated in England where it was
     a common tradition to eat a large meal after church
      services on Sundays.This meal is typically served on Sundays, 
    and it features roasted meat, mashed or roasted
     potatoes, and other accompaniments like stuffing, 
     gravy, mint sauce, and Yorkshire pudding. This mouthwatering 
     dish is also served with vegetables. Those could be roast 
     parsnips, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, peas, carrots,
      broccoli, or another seasonal option.

    You can find Sunday Roast at most pubs on Sundays, so 
    plan ahead if you want to do this during your trip.</p>

<h2>Top 5 interesting facts about Great Britain</h2>
</div>
</div>

<div class="fact1">
<h3> <strong>1.</strong> LONDON’S SUBWAY IS THE OLDEST IN THE WORLD </h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt">There are 180 subway systems in 56
     countries around the globe, but London’s famous “Tube” is the oldest.
    It took 10 years of discussion before the
     British government approved the construction 
     of an underground railway between Farringdon     
     Street and Bishop’s Road, Paddington.
      Work began in 1860 and the line officially 
      opened on January 10, 1863.   
    Today, the London Underground contains 11
     different lines that whisk up to 5 million 
     passengers across the city each day.

<h3> <strong>2.</strong>A WELSH TOWN HAS THE LONGEST NAME IN EUROPE </h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<img class="texxt-images" src="images/london19.jpg" height="400px" alt="">
 <p class="texxt">Would you like to a train
     to Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwlll­lantysiliogogogoch?
    If so, head over to Wales,
     where you’ll find the town with an impressive
      58 letters in its name.
    A weatherman pronounced it without missing 
    a beat during a live broadcast, but I’m fairly
     certain he practised (A LOT) before the camera started rolling.  
    The closed captioning listed “critical English
     mechanical problems like to see a go go go”
      as the town’s pronunciation, and that’s probably 
      as close as most of us will ever get!
    Bonus fact: As crazy as this Welsh name is, 
    it isn’t actually the longest name in the world.
 </p>                     
</div>

<div class="fact1">
<h3> <strong>3.</strong>THE ONGOING DEBATE ABOUT NATIONAL DISHES</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt1">Great Britain is made up of four
     countries — England, Scotland, Ireland, and
      Wales — that each has its own unique food identity. Although hearty
       meat-based dishes abound throughout the UK, individual favourites have emerged in each nation:

      England: Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, fish and chips, chicken tikka masala
      
      Ireland: Irish stew filled with mutton, onions,
       and potatoes
      
     Scotland: Haggis, a sheep’s stomach stuffed
      with offal, oatmeal, and onions
      
     Wales: Cawl, a stew made with bacon, leeks,
       cabbage, and either lamb or beef
      
      While I’m talking about funny British facts, here’s one more — chicken tikka masala is not a traditional Indian curry.

<h3> <strong>4.</strong>ITALY IS ALSO HOME TO THE WORLD'S SMALLEST COUNTRY</h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<img class="texxt-images" src="images/images79.jpg" height="350px" alt="">
<p class="texxt">
A country within a country – and a city? Yes, it’s true! 
Home to the Pope, Saint Peter’s Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, 
and famous museums, the Vatican City (Stato della città del 
Vaticano) is in Rome and is a city-state meaning it’s a country 
in its own right.Covering just 1,000 acres, the Vatican became a 
sovereign state in 1929, with the Pope as its head of state. 
It even has its own system of government, law, and military 
(the Swiss Guards).
What’s more, Italy also holds the fifth smallest country in 
the world within its borders: the microstate San Marino. 
Located in Italy’s northern mountains, it covers just over 
15,120 acres and is home to around 33,500 inhabitants. 
Founded in 301 AD, this small country is the oldest sovereign 
state in the world.

<h3> <strong>5.</strong>FRENCH WAS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE FOR 300 YEARS</h3>
<div class=" contextss">                                                                       
<p class="texxt">
    Parlez-vous français?

    If you lived in Britain between the 
    years 1066 and 1362, chances are you would have!
    
    Following the Norman Conquest of William 
    the Conqueror, French was the official language of England for nearly 300 years.
    
    Although English was still widely spoken
    by the lower classes, nobility and educated
     persons spoke French (and even Latin).
    
    The loss of Normandy and the ensuing Hundred 
    Years’ War against France led to a decline in 
    the use of French in the 14th century.
    
    English was named the official language of
     the courts in 1362 and it’s been that way ever since.
