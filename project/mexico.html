                        <p> <strong>Cancun</strong>
                            This huge resort city has two sides to
                            it; the upmarket hotels, brilliant spas
                            and expensive seafood restaurants contrast
                            with the concrete buildings that are
                            characteristic of the more residential neighborhoods.
                            Both are worth exploring, however, as the latter
                            is home to authentic salsa clubs, laid-back beach
                            bars and a plethora of cheap eating options,
                            while the local beaches remain untouched and beautiful.

                            the city is becoming more and more popular and
                            it’s easy to see why. Although most people come
                            for the beaches and incredible nightlife, which includes fantastic restaurants,

                            pounding clubs and lively bars, the natural
                            beauty of the surroundings and the amazing

                    <h2> Baja California</h2>
                    <p>
                        Tourists from Europe or the East Coast may find
                        it easier to fly into Mexico City or Cancun
                        . However, those from the West Coast often
                        drive down to San Diego and cross the land
                        border to Baja California. Some even fly
                        into San Diego and go straight from the
                        airport to the border. Baja California
                        is a Mexican state situated right
                        under California. Crossing the border
                        from San Diego to Tijuana is a quick
                        and easy process — you can drive over or cross by foot.
                        Instead of spending a lot of time in the border town of Tijuana,
                        head further south to the port city of Ensenada, where
                        you’ll find delicious food options, a quaint center, and nature hikes. </p>

                    <h2>San Juan Teotihuacan</h2>
                    <p>If you’ve ever seen a travel brochure
                        for Mexico, you’ve probably noticed
                        pictures of its famous pyramids. Many
                        fly into CDMX just to visit them; they’re
                        a short drive away, and you can go yourself
                        or as part of a tour.

                        San Juan Teotihuacan includes the Pyramid
                        of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon,
                        but it’s not limited to them; it’s a
                        massive archeological complex left
                        over from pre-Hispanic civilization.</p>

                        miles (ca. 241 km) from Mexico City is
                        San Miguel de Allende. Founded by a
                        monk, the town still does not have
                        any traffic lights, allowing you
                        to get a feel for the “real Mexico.”

                        However, it’s growing rapidly, as new
                        investors buy up land and build
                        resorts, so visit it before it
                        gets overcrowded over the next decade. </p>

                        Another fascinating place is Oaxaca. As the capital
                        of Oaxaca State, it’s a quiet city with
                        plenty of appealing bars, restaurants, and lively markets.
                        Its colorful buildings and one-way cobblestone streets may
                        make you want to stay forever.

                        But consider heading out to the mountains around Oaxaca,
                        as there are many tiny villages with fresh air and few tourists.

                        Depending on the season, it can get a bit chilly in the
                        city, so take a jacket or sweater. It’s a walkable place,
                        but you can always take a taxi or ride-share if you need to get somewhere further away.

                        Instead of being surrounded by mountains, you’ll
                        be able to appreciate the ocean air and take
                        walks on the beach at sunset.

                        The more adventurous traveler may rent
                        a scooter and take a trip out of town,

                    <h2>The Magical Towns</h2>
                    <p>Is an initiative led by Mexico's Secretariat
                        of Tourism, with support from other federal

                        agencies, to promote a series of towns around
                        the country that offer visitors "cultural richness, historical relevance,
                        cuisine, art crafts, and great hospitality".
                        It is intended to increase tourism to more
                        localities, especially smaller towns in rural areas.

                        The program promotes visiting small,
                        rural towns, where visitors may see
                        indigenous crafts, landscapes and
                        other attractions. The Government
                        created the 'Pueblos Mágicos' program
                        to recognize places across the country
                        that have certain characteristics and
                        traditions that make them unique,
                        and historically significant,
                        offering "magical" experiences to visitors.

                    <h2>The Mayan Ruins</h2>
                    <p>If you’re a history buff, a visit to
                        some Mayan ruins in addition
                        to Teotihuacan is a must-do.
                        Even if archeology doesn’t interest you
                        that much, they’re still worth seeing.

                        There are many Mayan ruins all over
                        Mexico, as the Mesoamerican civilization
                        stretched across much of the region. Regardless
                        of which part of the country you are visiting,
                        you’ll probably find some sort of ruins nearby.
                        The ruins are leftover remains of the cities the Mayans built.

                        If you’re staying in Yucatán, consider visiting
                        Chichen Itza, one of the most famous and most-visited ruins.
                        You can get there from Cancun. If you’re in Tulum, the Tulum ruins will be close by.

                    <h2> Riviera Maya</h2>
                    <p> Just south of Cancun, you’ll find The Riviera Maya, a stretch of the Caribbean
                        coastline in Yucatán. While most
                        tourists end up in Cancun, not as many visit The Riviera
                        Maya, allowing you less restricted access to its pristine beaches.

                        There are several popular resort towns in The Riviera
                        Maya. Among them are Tulum and Playa del Carmen. So,
                        which one of the three should you choose: Cancun, Tulum,
                        or Playa del Carmen?

                        Cancun is the biggest of the three. It’s a city, and even
                        on the beach, you’ll see many hotels on the beachfront
                        along with many other travelers. It’s a chill place, but
                        you can’t escape the urban vibes unless you head to Playa del Carmen.

                    <p>Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city,
                        is a dynamic cultural hub in the state of
                        Jalisco. This is the tequila-producing
                        region where Mariachi music was born,
                        as well as charrería, Mexico’s national
                        sport (don’t miss September’s annual
                        International Mariachi and Charrería Festival).

                        Must-sees in Guadalajara include a lienzo
                        (a charrería arena), the vivid frescoes
                        of the Instituto Cultural de Cabaña – a testament to
                        the genius of one-handed muralist José Clemente
                        Orozco – and the three-story Mercado San Juan

                    <h2>Pico de Orizaba</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pico de Orizaba is a symmetrical,
                        snow-capped volcano on the border of Puebla and
                        Veracruz states. Also called Citlaltépetl, it’s
                        the highest peak in Mexico and the third-highest
                        mountain in North America, with a summit
                        elevation of around 5636m (18,491ft) above sea level.

                        Dormant but not extinct, the last recorded eruption
                        was in 1846, and it is one of the most popular places
                        to visit in Mexico for serious climbers – professionals
                        prep there before taking on Mount Everest. Treks
                        start from the small village of Tlachichuca, and
                        the ascent requires some technical skills – Pico
                        de Orizaba is the ultimate trekking and climbing
                        challenge in Mexico.

                    <p>
                        Barbacoa is a term that is mostly associated with Mexico and refers to an ancient technique of
                        cooking meat in underground ovens. There are numerous regional varieties, which usually differ
                        in the type of meat or the cut, but the most common options include lamb, goat, or mutton—and
                        animal heads are traditionally regarded as a favorite barbacoa specialty. Mexican barbacoa
                        involved digging a hole in the ground, lining the bottom and the sides with rocks, and adding a
                        layer of burning wood, which would then be covered with agave leaves.</p>

                    <p>Quesadilla is a simple Mexican snack consisting of a flour or corn tortilla filled with cheese
                        that melts well. It is commonly folded in half and consumed. A quesadilla can also have some
                        other ingredients on the inside such as meats, beans, or potatoes, but cheese is always
                        mandatory (with the exception of Mexico City, where cheese in a quesadilla is often an
                        afterthought).</p>

                    <p>Burrito is a dish consisting of a wheat flour tortilla that is wrapped in such a way that it is
                        possible to fully enclose the flavorful filling on the interior. The filling consists of a
                        combination of various ingredients such as meat, beans, rice, lettuce, guacamole, and cheese,
                        among others.

                        Its name means little donkey in Spanish, and a popular theory suggests that it stems from the
                        way the bedrolls and packs appeared on the donkeys that carried them. Some claim that the dish
                        originated in the 19th century by either the vaqueros in Northern Mexico, farmers in California,
                        or the miners from Sonora. </p>

                        Tamal is a Mexican dish dating back to the Aztecs, consisting of corn masa dough with a filling
                        that can be either savory or sweet, steamed and wrapped in corn husks, leaves, or banana leaves.
                        The tamales are traditionally accompanied by atole, a masa drink.

                        Even though it is common for Mexican food to be served with a variety of sauces and salsas,
                        tamales are the exception because they are usually eaten plain and simple without any sauces,
                        although it is not a rule set in stone.

            <h3> <strong>1.</strong> WOMEN-ONLY CARRIAGES AND BUSES ARE AVAILABLE IN MEXICO'S METRO AND BUSES </h3>
            <div class=" contextss">
                <p class="texxt">Women in Mexico are actually very fortunate, despite the stereotype that they are
                    routinely oppressed. There are women-only buses in Mexico City, as well as separate subway parts for
                    women.

                    Perhaps this does not seem to be much of a luxury to anyone, but consider Turkey, where women on
                    public transportation are routinely harassed and no one is doing anything to protect them.

                    The Turkish government has not even contemplated establishing a separate section for women.
                    Furthermore, Mexican men are caballerosos, which means they often open the door for women, pick them
                    up before the date/meeting, and typically pay for anything.

                    Mexico has a greater variety of indigenous languages than any other nation on the American
                    continent. Indigenous languages, including Spanish, are recognised as national languages.

            <div class=" contextss">
                <p class="texxt1">The majority of people have always thought that the capital of Mexico is Mexico City.
                    The actual capital was Distrito Federal (DF) – the Federal District, In 2016, the city officially
                    changed its name for CDMX (Ciudad de Mexico).

                    It can be confusing because the Mexico City metropolitan area lies within DF and parts of the State
                    of Mexico. However, only the inhabitants of DF can say they live in the capital.
