                            Almost fairytale-like in terms of what is on offer, Sintra has domineering castles, elegant
                            palaces, luxurious villas and royal residences that will entice and astound visitors to this
                            beautiful part of the country. The undoubted highlight is the jaw dropping Pena Palace which
                            is bewitching in its uniqueness.

                            Portugal´s capital city has become increasingly popular with tourists in recent years and
                            it´s easy to see why. With its lovely weather, wealth of historical sites and picturesque
                            setting on the banks of the Tagus River; it´s a fantastic place to spend some time.</p>

                            alcohol when visiting the city in northern Portugal. Porto is a picturesque place with
                            vibrant colored buildings overlooking the Douro River and the famous white and blue tiles
                            that are so associated with the country are scattered around the city.</p>

                    <p>
                        One of Portugal’s most beautiful areas lies just east of Porto. Here, the meandering Rio Douro
                        flows past towering hillsides covered by the steeply terraced vineyards that make up Europe’s
                        oldest demarcated wine region. Whether you come by boat, train or car to the Douro Valley,
                        you’ll be rewarded with astonishing views at every turn, especially as you near the lovely
                        village of Pinhão in the heart of the region. </p>

                        of year, but come during one of its festivals and you're in for a special treat. Whether you
                        fancy the idea of a mock-up jousting match at a medieval fair or delving into the written word
                        at Folio – Portugal's biggest international literature festival – you couldn’t ask for a better

                        residents). A ferry ride, followed by a short bus or bicycle ride, takes you to the Costa da
                        Caparica, a seemingly endless beachfront that gets wilder and less crowded the further south you
                        go. If you want a surf lesson, some downtime on the sands, or a meal overlooking the lapping
                        waves, this is the place to come. </p>

                    <p>
                        The heart of the Alentejo region, Évora is one of Portugal’s most beautifully preserved medieval
                        towns, and it's an enchanting place to spend a couple of days. Inside the 14th-century walls,
                        narrow, winding lanes lead to striking monuments, including an elaborate medieval cathedral,
                        Roman ruins and a picturesque town square.

                        But this isn't a musty museum piece – Évora is also a lively university town, and its many
                        restaurants serve up some excellent, hearty Alentejan cuisine.

                    <h2> The Minho </h2>
                    <p>The Portuguese have a special fondness for the Minho, a verdant region of vineyard-covered
                        valleys, mountainous wilds, isolated beaches and picturesque river towns that seem little
                        changed by time. The gateway to the region is Braga, a city with Roman ruins, a fabled medieval
                        cathedral, and tranquil flower-trimmed plazas sprinkled with outdoor cafes and restaurants.

                        Further north, you’ll find Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês, a vast, rugged wilderness of
                        dramatic peaks, meandering streams and frozen-in-time stone villages. </p>

                        handsome medieval quarter houses one of Europe’s oldest universities. Students roam the narrow
                        streets clad in black capes, while the sound of fado (Portugal’s soulful traditional style of
                        music) drifts through the Moorish town gates towards the stained-glass windows of the historic
                        Café Santa Cruz.

                        scenery, outdoor adventures, and glimpses of a vanishing traditional way of life. Hikers can
                        choose from an expansive network of high-country trails with stupendous vistas, and the region's
                        fascinating mountain villages make perfect bases for outdoor adventures. At the country’s
                        highest point – the summit of Torre, artificially pushed to 2000m (6561ft) by the addition of a
                        not-so-subtle stone monument – you can slalom down Portugal’s only ski slope. Oh, and did we
                        mention the furry sheepdog puppies that frolic by the roadside? You’ll long to take one home.

                    <h2> The Algarve</h2>
                    <p> Sunseekers have much to celebrate in Portugal. Along the south coast, the Algarve is famed for
                        its gorgeous and varied coastline – you can either join the crowds on the people-packed sands at
                        major resorts or find seaside peace on dramatic wild beaches backed by wind-carved cliffs. Days
                        are spent playing in the waves, taking long oceanfront strolls, or surfing some of Europe's most
                        memorable breaks.

                        The Algarve is also one of the best places in Portugal for kids. You’ll find family-friendly
                        beaches, water parks and plenty of outdoor adventures (from boating to hidden sea caves to
                        exploring undeveloped islands).

                    <p>Three years ago, recently separated and in need of adventure, I took my two young sons to
                        Comporta for a week, a 90-minute drive south of Lisbon. Laid-back, boho, with glorious sandy
                        beaches, it was the best holiday we’d ever had. Lazy mornings in the infinity pool, afternoons
                        at the beach in Carvalhal eating huge doughnuts and jumping huge waves. Stopping at Ti Glória on
                        the way home to pick up the most delicious roast chicken, chips, grilled prawns, rice and
                        pickled veg – and only €7 for a huge takeaway tray.

                        If you’re in Lisbon, don’t miss the chance to visit the south bank of the River Tagus and enjoy
                        a meal from the terrace views at the restaurant Ponto Final of Lisbon’s red-tiled rooftops and
                        the 25 de Abril Bridge. Take the enjoyable ferry from Lisbon’s Cais do Sodré (every 10 minutes,
                        weekend every 20 minutes) to the other side of the river Tagus: Cacilhas, then walk along the
                        riverbank for 10 minutes. Our family sampled olives, fresh cheese from the Alentejo as starters,
                        then sea food salad, a huge octopus soup, then custard tarts, washing it down with a few tasty
                        glasses of Ponto Final’s house wine for €30 a head last spring.

                        Porto. This rich meat dish is made of tripe, beans and sausage. But while it is a common dish in
                        traditional restaurants in Porto, and with Portuguese Mothers and Grandmothers, it is becoming
                        less popular among the rising generations. So try some while you still can.</p>

                    <p>As a recent convert to vegetarianism, after one too many Francesinha hangovers, I am on the hunt
                        for the best Portugal has to offer for vegetarians. And although you can find excellent produce
                        at local markets, the Portuguese have yet to impress me with their vegetarian flair. As such,
                        you vegetarians should check your expectations, but check back in a few years. The Portuguese
                        are slowly adapting to a more vegetarian angle and I’m sure have something spectacular up their

                    <h2>Pasteis de Nata</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pastel de nata is definitely the most popular and most famous Portuguese dessert. You can find
                        pasteis de nata in any bakery or coffee shop in Portugal. These ‘Portuguese Tarts’ are also
                        found in Portuguese communities around the world.

                        Pastel de nata is egg custard in filo dough, served with cinnamon. If you can get them warm,
                        fresh out of the oven, it’s your lucky day. Although the ingredients are always the same,
                        different bakeries will have slightly different styles. Don’t be afraid to have a Nata daily
                        while in Portugal.

                        The most famous place to get this tasty dessert while in Portugal is in Antiga Confeitaria de
                        Belém bakery in Belem, Lisbon. This bakery is really popular among both tourists and locals.

            <div class=" contextss">
                <p class="texxt">The borders of the nation of Portugal were defined in 1139, making it not only one of
                    the oldest nations in the world but arguably in all of Europe. Portugal appointed King Afonso
                    Henriques as its king that year. Fun fact: Lisbon is actually four centuries older than Rome. Before
                    it was known as Portugal, the territory had been settled by various empires and civilizations such
                    as by the Phoenicians in 1200 BC.

                    Verde, and São Tomé and Príncipe. Therefore it’s not that surprising that only 5% of Portuguese

                    On July 1, 2001, Portugal became the first country in the world to decriminalize all drugs,
                    including meth and heroin. The law made drug possession for personal use legally prohibited, while
                    drug trafficking remains a criminal offense. The change in law was applied as a measure to fight the
                    heightened drug epidemic of the 90s and the rise of HIV cases. Portugal now has some of the lowest
                    drug usage rates in the European Union (EU), where most countries hold criminalization models.
