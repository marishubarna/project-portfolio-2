                    <h2>Cat Café Asakusa Nekoen</h2>
                    <p>The Cat Cafe is a new part of Japanese
                         culture, and provides a healing space 
                         for cat lovers to interact with feline 
                         companions. Here, you have the opportunity
                          to stroke cats, play with them, take 
                          photographs or just watch them sleeping.
                        While all our cats have previously been 
                        abandoned by their owners, they are all 
                        completely domesticated and adorable, 
                        and are just the companions to energize
                         and rejuvenate you. Relax, and unwind 
                         – you're visiting friends! More than
                          ten cats are looking forward to seeing 
                          you; some of them are even looking for
                           foster parents!
                        We're just 6–9 minutes' walk from 
                        Asakusa Station on the Tobu, Ginza and 
                        Toei lines.</p>

                    <h2>Totoro Café and Bakery</h2>
                    <p>Located in the quiet neighborhood of 
                        Setagaya-Daita (and not far from Shimokita), 
                        the Totoro Café & Bakery seems to come
                         straight out of Hayao Miyazaki’s fantasy 
                         world. Hidden in a backstreet, surrounded
                          by trees, the two-story house includes 
                          both a café and bakery. And with a few 
                          tables outside, it is the perfect spot
                           for a sweets break this spring.
                        The café area is located on the second 
                        floor of the house. Although it only has 
                        seven or eight tables, the large windows
                        overlooking the courtyard give a feeling
                         of openness to the room. They serve a 
                         range of homemade dishes such as fresh 
                         pasta, salad and a great selection of
                          desserts. But there is one item on the
                           menu that almost everyone is here for: 
                           Totoro Cream Puffs.</p>
