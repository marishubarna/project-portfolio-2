<h2>Lokum</h2>
 <p>
Lokum, known in English as Turkish Delight, dates 
back centuries. However, it wasn’t until the mid-19th 
century that it became a hit with the Ottoman sultans.
That’s when corn starch was invented and Istanbul 
confectioner Haci Bekir added it to the list of ingredients.
This simple combination of water, starch and sugar – boiled 
together to produce delicate cubes flavored with rose water, 
pistachio and other flavors – continues to delight.</p>

<h2>Börek</h2>
<p>Börek is a baked dish consisting of a savory or sweet 
filling wrapped in yufka - thinly stretched sheets of dough 
made with flour, water, and salt. Heartier than phyllo, but 
thinner than a tortilla, hand-made yufka is typically brushed 
with butter before baking.
Although many countries have their own versions of this 
satisfying dish, it was probably invented during the Ottoman 
Empire in the Anatolian Provinces, an area that nowadays 
belongs to Turkey. Some sources suggest that börek might 
be even older, a descendant of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) 
Anatolian dish known as en tyritas plakountas, consisting of 
layered dough filled with cheese, its recipe dating back to 160 BC. </p>

<h2>Dondurma</h2>
<p>Turkish ice cream is believed to originate from the 
city of Maraş—hence the name—and what really sets it 
apart from other varieties is its resistance to melting 
and a particularly dense, chewy texture. These qualities 
are brought by adding two thickening agents to the basic 
milk and sugar mixture: Arab gum, also known as mastic 
resin, and salep—a type of flour made from the root of 
the early purple orchid.
In fact, in the Kahramanmaraş region, ice cream typically 
contains distinctly more salep than usual, which is why it 
is sometimes called kesme dondurma—from the Turkish kesmek, 
meaning to cut—which is the reason why this ice cream variety 
is usually eaten with a knife and fork. </p>

traditional clay bowl, Sutlac is a specific type of
yummy rice pudding that has been cooked. The top of 
the pudding is broiled, thus giving it a

<h2>Doner kebab</h2>
<p>The only Turkish persons who do not love doner kebab 
are vegetarians, but all the others will do
anything they can to have a piece of this food. To prepare 
doner kebab, you have to stack
seasoned meat onto a screwer which is in the shape of an inverted 
cone; then it is made to turn
as it cooks. It is this behavior or turning while it is cooking 
that gave it the name, doner, which
means something that turns.
After the meat has cooked well, it is sliced off in thin strips. 
The underneath section, which has
not cooked well, is left to cook. You serve doner kebab with pickles 
and tomatoes.</p>

<h3> <strong>3.</strong>WINE PRODUCTION IS IMPORTANT </h3>
<div class=" contextss">
<p class="texxt1">If you love to enjoy a glass of wine on its

Turkey facts is that wine production is a big thing in this

such as France, when they think of wine, Turkey is big on wine. 
First of all, Turkey was one of the earliest wine producers. 
Additionally, Turkey is the fourth-largest producer of wine 
grapes in the world. This is because of the climate and fertile 
soil. So if you’re driving through Turkey, don’t be surprised 
to pass by many vineyards! We visited a beautiful vineyard when 
exploring Cappadocia.
